# The First Adam and the Last Adam

The Bible explicitly calls Jesus "the last Adam" (1 Corinthians 15:45). This isn't just poetic language—it's revealing a profound parallel that unlocks the entire story of redemption.

## Two Men, Two Destinies

Paul writes in Romans 5:12-19 that just as one man (Adam) brought sin and death into the world, one man (Jesus) brings righteousness and life. But the parallel goes much deeper than that.

Let me show you what I've found.

## The Parallels

### **Creation and Birth**

**Adam:** Formed from dust, breathed into by God (Genesis 2:7)  
**Jesus:** Born of a virgin, conceived by the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35)

Both entered the world in unique, miraculous ways—outside the normal pattern of human generation.

### **The Garden and the Wilderness**

**Adam:** Tested in a perfect garden with every provision (Genesis 2-3)  
**Jesus:** Tested in a barren wilderness with nothing (Matthew 4:1-11)

Adam had everything and failed. Jesus had nothing and succeeded.

---

### **The Tree**

**Adam:** Disobeyed at a tree, bringing death (Genesis 3:6)  
**Jesus:** Obeyed on a tree (the cross), bringing life (1 Peter 2:24)

The very symbol of Adam's failure became the instrument of Christ's victory.

### **The Woman**

**Adam:** From his side came Eve, the mother of all living (Genesis 2:21-22)  
**Jesus:** From his pierced side came blood and water, and from his side (metaphorically) came the Church, his bride (John 19:34, Ephesians 5:25-32)

---

### **Dominion Lost and Restored**

**Adam:** Given dominion over creation, lost it through sin (Genesis 1:28, 3:17-19)  
**Jesus:** Regained all authority in heaven and earth (Matthew 28:18)

What Adam surrendered, Christ reclaimed.

---

### **The Title of "Son of God"**

**Adam:** Called "son of God" in Luke's genealogy (Luke 3:38)  
**Jesus:** The beloved Son, the only begotten Son (Matthew 3:17, John 3:16)

Adam was God's son by creation. Jesus is God's Son by nature.

## What This Means for Us

Here's what gets me: we're not just saved *by* Jesus—we're saved *into* Jesus.

Romans 5:19 says: "For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous."

We were in Adam by birth. We're in Christ by faith.

Everything Adam lost, Christ restored. Everything Adam was supposed to be, Christ became. And when we're united to Christ, we become what Adam was meant to be: the image-bearers of God, living in right relationship with our Creator.

## The Bigger Picture

This parallel shows us that redemption isn't God's Plan B. From the very beginning, there was always going to be a Last Adam to undo what the First Adam did.

The story of humanity is the story of two men: one who failed, and one who succeeded. And we get to choose which man we're united to.
