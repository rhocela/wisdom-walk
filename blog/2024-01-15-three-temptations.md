# The Three Temptations: Eden and the Wilderness

There's a striking pattern between Adam's temptation in Eden and Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. Both faced three types of temptation—and their responses reveal everything about redemption.

## The Pattern

### 1. **The Lust of the Flesh** - Physical Appetite

**Eden (Genesis 3:6):** "The woman saw that the fruit of the tree was *good for food*..."

**Wilderness (Matthew 4:3-4):** "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."

Both temptations appeal to legitimate physical needs in illegitimate ways. Eve saw food that looked appealing. Jesus was hungry after 40 days of fasting.

**The difference:** 
- Adam and Eve: Took what God had forbidden
- Jesus: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God"

### 2. **The Lust of the Eyes** - Pride and Ambition

**Eden (Genesis 3:6):** "...and *pleasing to the eye*..."

**Wilderness (Matthew 4:8-10):** "The devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor."

Both faced the temptation of grasping for glory and power outside of God's timing and means.

**The difference:**
- Adam and Eve: Reached for knowledge and status God had forbidden
- Jesus: "Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only"

---

### 3. **The Pride of Life** - Presumption on God

**Eden (Genesis 3:6):** "...and also *desirable for gaining wisdom*..."

**Wilderness (Matthew 4:5-7):** "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down..."

Both faced the temptation to presume on God's promises or test his protection.

**The difference:**
- Adam and Eve: Believed the serpent's promise over God's word
- Jesus: "Do not put the Lord your God to the test"

## What This Shows Us

The parallel isn't just interesting—it's essential. 

Where the first Adam failed, the second Adam (Christ) succeeded. Jesus faced the same three categories of temptation that brought down humanity, but he stood firm.

**1 John 2:16** even summarizes these three:
> "For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world."

## The Bigger Picture

This parallel shows us:
- Temptation follows predictable patterns
- Christ succeeded where we failed
- His victory becomes ours through faith
- The same strategies that defeated Adam are still used today

When you're tempted, you're not facing something new. You're facing one of these three. And because Christ overcame them all, you can too.
