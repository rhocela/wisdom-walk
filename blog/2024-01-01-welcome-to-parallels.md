# Welcome to Parallels

As I've been reading through Scripture, I keep seeing these amazing patterns. Stories that echo each other. Events that mirror one another. Characters whose lives seem to follow the same divine script.

These aren't coincidences.

## What Are Biblical Parallels?

Biblical parallels are recurring patterns, themes, and structures that appear throughout Scripture. They're like threads woven through the entire Bible, connecting Genesis to Revelation.

Some examples:
- Adam and Jesus (the first and last Adam)
- The three types of temptation in Eden and the wilderness
- Joseph's story foreshadowing Christ's journey
- The Red Sea crossing and baptism
- The tabernacle and Christ's body

## Why Do They Matter?

When you start seeing these parallels, Scripture comes alive in a new way. You realize the Bible isn't just a collection of separate stories—it's *one* story told in different keys.

These patterns show us:
- God's consistent character and methods
- How the Old Testament points to Christ
- The unity and divine authorship of Scripture
- Deeper layers of meaning in familiar passages

## How This Works

Each post will explore one parallel or pattern. I'll show you where to find it, how it connects, and what it reveals about God's bigger plan.

Some will be short observations. Others will be deeper dives.

Feel free to explore them in any order, or use the tags to find patterns on specific themes.

Let's discover these connections together.
