# Science & Scripture

<div className="subtitle">Where discovery meets divine revelation</div>

**Welcome to Science & Scripture!**

Here we explore the fascinating intersections where scientific discoveries align with biblical truth, showing how God's written Word and His created world tell the same story.

## What You'll Discover

- **Archaeological Confirmations**: Discoveries like the Isaiah Scrolls, Noah's Ark findings, and ancient cities
- **Astronomical Alignments**: Space discoveries that echo biblical accounts
- **Biological Wonders**: Plant and animal life that reflects biblical descriptions
- **Mathematical Design**: God's intentional patterns and significant numbers throughout creation and Scripture
- **Scientific Prophecy**: Biblical passages that preceded scientific understanding by millennia

## Our Approach

We approach this topic with:
- **Reverence for Scripture**: The Bible is our foundation, not science
- **Appreciation for Discovery**: God reveals Himself through both revelation and creation
- **Intellectual Honesty**: Exploring genuine connections, not forcing parallels
- **Wonder and Worship**: Seeing how science can deepen our awe of God

## Remember

Science doesn't validate Scripture - Scripture stands on its own authority. But when we see creation confirming the Creator's Word, our hearts are filled with wonder at His magnificent design.
