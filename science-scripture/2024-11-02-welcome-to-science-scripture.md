# Welcome to Science & Scripture

:::info Under Construction
This section is currently being developed. Content will be added regularly as we explore the beautiful harmony between scientific discovery and biblical truth.
:::

"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands." - Psalm 19:1

For too long, science and faith have been portrayed as enemies. But what if they're actually allies? What if every scientific discovery is another verse in God's song of creation?

## The False Divide

Somewhere along the way, we started believing we had to choose: either trust science *or* trust Scripture. But this is a false choice. The same God who inspired the Bible also created the natural laws that science discovers.

## What We'll Explore

In this space, we'll discover how:

- **Quantum physics** reveals the mysterious nature of reality that Scripture has always proclaimed
- **Cosmology** confirms the biblical account of a universe with a beginning
- **Genetics** shows the intricate design that speaks of an intelligent Creator
- **Neuroscience** illuminates the biblical understanding of mind, soul, and spirit
- **Ecology** demonstrates the interconnected design that Genesis describes

## Our Approach

We're not trying to "prove" the Bible with science (Scripture needs no defense), nor are we dismissing genuine scientific discovery. Instead, we're celebrating how both reveal different aspects of the same magnificent truth.

Each post will:
- Present a genuine scientific discovery or principle
- Show how it aligns with (rather than contradicts) biblical truth
- Explore what this harmony reveals about God's character and creation

## Why This Matters

When we see science and Scripture as complementary revelation—one written in the language of mathematics and natural law, the other in human words inspired by the Holy Spirit—our faith deepens and our wonder grows.

Let's explore this beautiful harmony together.

*"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made."* - Romans 1:20
