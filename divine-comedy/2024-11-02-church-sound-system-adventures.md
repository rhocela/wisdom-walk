# Church Sound System Adventures

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord!" - Psalm 100:1

Apparently, some of us take this verse more literally than others—especially when we're wrestling with the church sound system.

## The Great Feedback Incident

Last Sunday, Brother Mike was setting up for special music. He's a sweet man who could fix a tractor with his eyes closed but treats the soundboard like it might explode.

As he leaned over to adjust the mic, we heard:

*SQUEEEEEEEEEEAL!*

The feedback was so loud that Mrs. Henderson's hearing aid started whistling in harmony. The poor woman thought she was receiving divine revelation through her ear piece.

Meanwhile, Mike jumped back from the mic like it was a snake, hands up in surrender, mouthing "I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING!" to the sound booth.

## The Mysterious Mute Button

Our sound operator, teenage Josh, knows every button on that board. But somehow, every Sunday morning, the pastor's mic gets mysteriously muted at the most inopportune moments.

Pastor will be mid-sermon, building to his crescendo: "And Jesus said unto the multitude—"

*Silence.*

We all see his mouth moving with great passion, but hear nothing. Josh frantically starts pushing buttons like he's defusing a bomb.

Pastor, unaware, continues his silent sermon until someone from the front row starts wildly gesticulating. He taps the mic: *thump thump* "Is this thing on?"

Josh's face turns three shades of red as sound returns: "—SO REPENT AND BE SAVED!"

The volume, of course, is now at maximum.

## The Bluetooth Bandit

Two weeks ago, we had our monthly fellowship dinner. Sister Carol was trying to play gentle background music from her phone when suddenly, right in the middle of Elder Thompson's blessing over the potluck:

*"SWEET CAROLINE! BUM BUM BUM!"*

Turns out her phone had connected to the church sound system. Elder Thompson, without missing a beat, finished his prayer: "And Lord, we thank you for Sister Carol's... enthusiasm. Amen."

The whole room erupted in laughter. Even Carol couldn't stop giggling long enough to find the pause button.

## Why We Love It

Here's the thing: these sound system shenanigans have become part of our church family charm. We've learned to expect the unexpected, roll with the technical difficulties, and find joy in the chaos.

Because sometimes the most genuine worship happens not when everything goes perfectly, but when we're all laughing together at our beautifully imperfect attempts to "make a joyful noise."

And honestly? I think God enjoys our sound system adventures too. After all, He made us, quirks and all.

*"A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones."* - Proverbs 17:22
