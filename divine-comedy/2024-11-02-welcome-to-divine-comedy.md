"A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones." - Proverbs 17:22

Life with God isn't just profound—it's also wonderfully, surprisingly, joyfully funny. Welcome to Divine Comedy, where we celebrate the lighter side of faith.

## Sacred Joy

Laughter is a gift from God. Think about it: humans are pretty much the only creatures that laugh at stories, find humor in unexpected connections, and can be tickled by wordplay. We were designed for delight.

And our faith? It's full of moments that would make us smile if we noticed them:

- Abraham laughing at God's promise of a baby (Genesis 17:17)
- Elijah's sarcastic commentary during the Baal showdown (1 Kings 18:27)
- Jesus using humor to make points (imagine a camel trying to squeeze through a needle's eye!)
- Paul's wordplay that gets lost in translation

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't about making fun *of* faith—it's about finding the joy *in* faith. We'll share:

- **Gentle humor** found in Scripture itself
- **Funny observations** about church life and Christian culture
- **Joyful stories** from everyday faith experiences
- **Uplifting moments** that make us smile and point us toward God
- **Wholesome entertainment** that celebrates rather than tears down

## Why Laughter Matters

Joy is one of the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22). When we laugh together—especially about the quirks and surprises of following Jesus—we're participating in something sacred.

Laughter:
- Builds community and connection
- Provides relief from life's pressures
- Reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously
- Points to the ultimate joy awaiting us in heaven

## Our Heart

Everything here will be:
- **Clean and wholesome** - humor that builds up rather than tears down
- **Loving** - we laugh *with* each other, not *at* each other
- **Faith-affirming** - finding joy in the journey, not mocking the destination

Come find some joy. God loves to see His children smile.

*"He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy."* - Job 8:21
