"A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones." - Proverbs 17:22

Life with God isn't just profound—it's also wonderfully, surprisingly, joyfully funny. Welcome to Divine Comedy, where we share Bible jokes, dad jokes, and clean humor that points us toward joy.

## Sacred Joy

Laughter is a gift from God. Think about it: humans are pretty much the only creatures that laugh at wordplay, puns, and silly jokes. We were designed for delight.

And faith? It provides some of the best material for wholesome humor:

- Abraham having a baby at 100 (talk about late-life surprises!)
- David taking down Goliath with a slingshot (the ultimate underdog story)
- Jonah getting a ride from a big fish (worst Uber experience ever)
- Jesus using everyday situations to make divine points (imagine the disciples' faces!)

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't about making fun *of* faith—it's about finding the joy *in* faith. We'll share:

- **Bible jokes** and puns that make you groan and smile
- **Dad jokes** with a faith twist
- **Clean humor** that's family-friendly
- **Wordplay** that celebrates the richness of Scripture
- **Lighthearted observations** about faith and life

## Why Laughter Matters

Joy is one of the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22). When we laugh together—especially at clever wordplay and innocent humor—we're participating in something sacred.

Laughter:
- Builds community and connection
- Provides relief from life's pressures  
- Reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously
- Points to the ultimate joy awaiting us in heaven
- Shows appreciation for the cleverness God built into language and life

## Our Heart

Everything here will be:
- **Clean and wholesome** - humor that builds up rather than tears down
- **Family-friendly** - safe for all ages
- **Faith-affirming** - finding joy in our shared faith journey
- **Groan-worthy** - because the best dad jokes make you groan *and* laugh

Come find some joy. After all, if God gave us the ability to laugh at puns, He must have a sense of humor too!

*"He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy."* - Job 8:21
