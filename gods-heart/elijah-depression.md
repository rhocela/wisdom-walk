# When Depression Strikes: Elijah's Story

*Connected to Bible Bridge readings about Elijah*

## The Context: The Downward Spiral of Human Hearts

Before we dive into Elijah's story, it's important to understand the spiritual climate he was ministering in. King Ahab "did more evil in the eyes of the Lord than any of those before him" (1 Kings 16:30), and this pattern of increasing wickedness had been building for generations. Even the good kings like Solomon, David, and Jehoshaphat showed the overall downward trend of human hearts—evidence that "the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure" (Jeremiah 17:9).

This wasn't just political opposition Elijah faced; it was the full weight of humanity's evil tendencies manifesting in his generation.

## The Setup: God's Incredible Faithfulness

Despite this dark spiritual climate, God had shown Himself incredibly faithful to Elijah:

When the drought started, as soon as Elijah declared it by God's word, the Lord provided for him:
- **Ravens bringing food** during drought (1 Kings 17:6)
- **Widow's oil and flour** that never ran out (1 Kings 17:14-16)
- **Resurrection of the widow's son** (1 Kings 17:17-24) - Sidenote: Elijah's initial response to the widow when her son died was to question God, showing even prophets can struggle with doubt in hard moments. He askd did you (God) intend to bring this tragedy on her? This shows that even great men of God can wrestle with doubt and confusion in the midst of suffering. And he was concerned for his reputation as the widow might think poorly of him if her son died under his care.
- **Fire from heaven** on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18:38)
- **Rain after years of drought** (1 Kings 18:45)

God had shown Himself faithful in every impossible situation, culminating in one of the most history-making moments when Elijah called down fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice, proving that the LORD is God (1 Kings 18:36-39). This was a huge victory for both Elijah and for God's reputation.

## The Trigger: One Threat Changes Everything

After all these miracles, **one threat from Jezebel** sent Elijah into despair:

> "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them." (1 Kings 19:2)

Suddenly, this man who had just called down fire from heaven was running for his life, asking God to let him die. Despite all these incredible experiences, one threat from an ungodly character reveals how fragile the human heart can be, even for someone as mighty as Elijah.

## Our tendency toward depression and despair

- The trigger: One threat from Jezebel (1 Kings 19:2)
- Fear: "I am the only one left" (1 Kings 19:10) 
- Isolation: Elijah fled to the wilderness alone (1 Kings 19:3) (left his servant in Beersheba)
- Sleep/withdrawal/idleness: Elijah slept under a broom tree (1 Kings 19:5) twice after being fed by the angel (1 Kings 19:6-7)

## God's Response: Tender Care, Not Rebuke - he ministers to us then he asks where we are

Notice how God responds to Elijah's depression—He doesn't condemn Elijah for his feelings. Instead, He meets him in his despair with compassion and care:

### 1. **Physical Care First**
- Provides sleep and rest (1 Kings 19:5)
- Sends an angel with food and water (1 Kings 19:6-7)
- Lets him sleep more (1 Kings 19:7)

God provides for Elijah's physical needs first: rest, food, and water. Depression affects us physically, and God's first response was rest and nourishment, not a spiritual lecture.

Supernatural strength - it said the food gave him strength for forty days and nights of travel (1 Kings 19:8). Where did he go to? To Mount Horeb, the mountain of God, where Moses had encountered God (Exodus 3). This shows that God was leading Elijah to a place of divine encounter and renewal. Is it where he heard God's gentle whisper? Answer: Yes, it is likely that Elijah heard God's gentle whisper at Mount Horeb after his journey fueled by the angel's provision.

Personal notes: It seems like God in my life if i encounter something would always have one aspect being good/supernatural for me. E.g. when i suffer heartache, I would be at a state of financial security. If at financial lack, i would be at a state of emotional peace with family or relationships. It's as if God knows what i can / cannot bear. That's why I admire the strength of people who seem to have everything upside down, because that means the strength it takes is supernatural whether they blieve it or not, or know it or not. 

### God asks us where we are when we are lost

He asks us not because He doesn't know, but because He cares and wants us to reflect on our situation. This question invites us into a deeper conversation with Him about our feelings and circumstances
- Adam: "Where are you?" (Genesis 3:9)
- Cain: "Where is your brother Abel?" (Genesis 4:9)
- Noah: "Where is the wood for the burnt offering?" (Genesis 8:20-21)
- Abraham: "Where is Sarah your wife?" (Genesis 18:9)
- Moses: "Where are your gods?" (Exodus 32:23)
- Elijah: "What are you doing here, Elijah?" (1 Kings 19:9,13). His answer reveals his despair and sense of failure: "I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty, but the Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too." (1 Kings 19:10)
    - David: "Why are you downcast, O my soul?" (Psalm 42:5)


### 2. **Gentle Presence**
- Not in the wind, earthquake, or fire
- In a "gentle whisper" (1 Kings 19:12)
- Simply asks: "What are you doing here, Elijah?" (1 Kings 19:13)

God gently asks Elijah what is wrong, allowing him to express his feelings, and reassures him that he is not alone—there are still others who follow Him.

### 3. **God does not abandon us neither will he force us to continue**

He asked Elijah what he was doing there, not to condemn him, but to invite him into a deeper conversation about his feelings and circumstances. God understands our weakness and meets us where we are.

He asked twice, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" (1 Kings 19:9, 13) but Elijah had the same answer both times, revealing his deep discouragement: "I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty, but the Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too." (1 Kings 19:10)

So God provides for Elijah's future without forcing him to continue. He gives Elijah instructions for his next steps, including anointing new leaders. This shows that even in our darkest moments, Gfod is already working out His plans for us.

God is in the whisper verse: 1 Kings 19:12 "After the fire came a gentle whisper." NIV


### 4. **Gracious Provision for the Future** - even when we think it's the end - relate to our dog-  (mention bird* shelter and protection  if not freedom)
- Doesn't force Elijah to continue
- Provides Elisha as his successor (1 Kings 19:16)
- Shows care for both Elijah AND the people's needs

God gives Elijah instructions for his next steps, including anointing new leaders. This shows that even in our darkest moments, God is already working out His plans for us. Not only did God not abandon Elijah, He didn't force him to continue his ministry. In fact, Elijah would later exit the earth in one of the most amazing ways humanly possible—being taken up to heaven without dying (2 Kings 2:11).

## What This Shows Us About God's Heart

### **He Understands Our Weakness**
Even after witnessing God's power, we can still be overwhelmed by fear and discouragement. God doesn't condemn this - He meets us there.

When God says "Don't be afraid," "Do not be discouraged," or "Don't worry," He is not someone to whom we can say "easy for you to say." As the Bible says, He relates to our weaknesses (Hebrews 4:15). He has been there and experienced being forsaken ultimately on the cross (Psalm 22:1-5, Matthew 27:46) by EVERYONE.

### **He Cares for Our Bodies**
Depression affects us physically. God's first response was rest and nourishment, not a spiritual lecture.

### **He Speaks Gently (WHISPERS) in Our Dark Moments**
When we're fragile, God whispers rather than shouts. His voice is tender, not condemning.

We should not be surprised by emotional crashes after spiritual highs; they are a normal part of the human experience. We can listen for God's gentle whisper in our dark moments, trusting that He is present and caring for us. We don't need elaborate signs or dramatic interventions to know that God is with us; most of the time, His presence is found in the quiet and the stillness.

Examples of this in the Bible where God "whispered" to someone or showed up in a non-elaborate way:

| Phrase | Full Verse |
|--------|------------|
| Elijah in the gentle breeze | "The Lord said, 'Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.' Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'" (1 Kings 19:11-13) |
| Jesus withdrawing to solitary places | "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed." (Mark 1:35) |
| Samuel hearing God's voice at night | "The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, 'Samuel! Samuel!' Then Samuel said, 'Speak, for your servant is listening.'" (1 Samuel 3:10) |
| Hannah praying silently in the temple | "In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly... Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard." (1 Samuel 1:10, 13) |
| Jesus praying in Gethsemane | "Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. On reaching the place, he said to them, 'Pray that you will not fall into temptation.' He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, 'Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.'" (Luke 22:39-42) |
| David finding God in the silence | "Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth." (Psalm 46:10) |
| Paul's contentment in all circumstances | "I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength." (Philippians 4:11-13) |
| David hearing God's guidance in the night | "I will praise the Lord, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the Lord. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken." (Psalm 16:7-8) |


### **He Provides for Our Future**
Even when we feel like giving up, God is already preparing what comes next. His faithfulness extends beyond our current feelings—not only for us individually, but for His greater purposes with His people.

## Seeing Jesus in Elijah's Story

### The Mount Carmel Victory Points to Christ's Sacrifice

Elijah's victory over Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18:20-40) foreshadows Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death through His sacrifice on the cross (Hebrews 10:12-14).

The bull that was consumed by fire represents the perfect sacrifice that Christ fulfilled once and for all. It was completely consumed, representing Jesus being physically and spiritually consumed on the cross for our sins. But unlike the bull that was permanently consumed, Jesus rose again, defeating death itself.

Other powerful connections include:
- **The 12 stones** representing the 12 tribes of Israel highlight the unity of God's people and foreshadow the new covenant community established by Christ (Ephesians 2:19-22)
- **The water poured three times** over the sacrifice symbolizes the cleansing power of Christ's blood, which washes away sin and makes us holy (1 John 1:7, Hebrews 9:14)

### Deeper Parallels Between Elijah and Jesus

- **Prophetic calling**: Elijah's role as a prophet who calls people back to God parallels Jesus' ministry of calling sinners to repentance and faith in Him (Matthew 4:17, Mark 1:15)
- **Miraculous power**: Both performed miracles that demonstrated God's power and authority (Elijah with fire from heaven, Jesus with healing and raising the dead)
- **Opposition from religious leaders**: Both faced resistance from the religious establishment of their time (Elijah from the prophets of Baal, Jesus from the Pharisees and Sadducees)
- **Intimate relationship with the Father**: Both had close relationships with God the Father, often withdrawing to pray and seek His guidance
- **Unique departures**: Both were taken up to heaven in extraordinary ways (Elijah in a whirlwind, Jesus in His ascension)
- **Messianic connection**: Both are associated with the coming of the Messiah (Elijah as a forerunner, Jesus as the Messiah Himself)

## For Us Today

When depression strikes:
- **Remember God's past faithfulness** (like Elijah should have remembered the miracles)
- **Don't be surprised by emotional crashes** after spiritual highs—they're part of the human experience
- **Listen for God's gentle whisper**, not just dramatic signs
- **Trust that God is preparing provision** even when you can't see it

Hi! I'm a total beginner to pilates & yoga and would like to try it -- my fitness background is limited (I did basic muay thai and fitboxing in the past) and I'm looking for something low-impact to start with. Do you have programs for beginners like myself?
