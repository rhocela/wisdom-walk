# Welcome to God's Heart

<div className="subtitle">🫀 Seeking His voice through Scripture and life</div>

Welcome to a space where we explore the tender, powerful, and mysterious heart of our God. This isn't just theology—it's relationship. It's discovery. It's wrestling with Scripture and life to better understand who God really is.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

Daily musings and experiences that lead us back to God's Word:

### **Theological Reflections**
Wrestling with the big questions:
- Why does God reveal Himself as Father?
