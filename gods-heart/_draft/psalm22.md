## [Psalm 22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.22.ESV)
1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

- In the past, no chapter # reference so they would say the first line of the Psalm to call it. 
- Historical context of Jews not having chapter numbers until the Middle Ages (that means until the year 1200 ): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_and_verse_numbers_in_the_Bible#History (summary: Jewish texts didn't have chapter numbers until the Middle Ages; Christians added them in the 13th century; Psalms were traditionally referred to by their opening words rather than chapter numbers. Who practiced this: Jewish communities and early Christians both used the opening words of Psalms to identify them before chapter numbers were introduced.) Real life example of how rabbies or Jewish teachers would refer to Psalms by their opening words rather than chapter numbers: https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/63209/jewish/How-to-Study-Psalms.htm ("In traditional Jewish study, Psalms are often referred to by their opening words rather than by chapter numbers. For example, Psalm 23 is commonly called 'Mizmor LeDavid' (A Psalm of David), which are its opening words.") Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning? what language is Mizmor LeDavid? Hebrew. Another example: Psalm 119 is called "Ashrei Temimei Derech" (Happy are those whose way is blameless), which are its opening words in Hebrew. And so whenever says "Mizmor le davaid" this means they are asking the person to turn to Psalm 22. For example if I was a rabbi teaching a class on the Psalms and I wanted to refer to Psalm 22, I would say "Let us now turn to Mizmor LeDavid" instead of saying "Let us now turn to Psalm 22." This was the traditional way of referring to Psalms before chapter numbers were introduced in the Middle Ages.



## 15 My mouth[d] is dried up like a potsherd,
- Mouth dried up like a potsherd: This vivid metaphor illustrates extreme thirst and dehydration. A potsherd is a broken piece of pottery, which, when dried out, becomes brittle and cracked. in medical terms this could indicate severe dehydration, possibly due to conditions like **hypovolemia** (a significant loss of body fluids) . this can be caused by factors such as prolonged fasting, severe diarrhea, or excessive sweating without adequate fluid replacement. The imagery of a dried potsherd effectively conveys the psalmist's intense physical suffering and desperation for relief. Dr. Alexander Metherell book about crucifixion: "The dehydration resulting from crucifixion would lead to a parched mouth and throat, making it difficult for the victim to speak or cry out for help. This physical state of extreme thirst is poignantly captured in [Psalm 22:15](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.22.15.ESV), where the psalmist describes his mouth as being 'dried up like a potsherd,' highlighting the severity of his suffering and the desperate need for relief." (Source: Metherell, Alexander. *The Crucifixion: Understanding the Physical Trauma of Christ's Death*. 2014.)

[Matthew 27:46](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.27.46.ESV) and [Mark 15:34](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MRK.15.34.ESV) both quote [Psalm 22:1](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.22.1.ESV), where Jesus cries out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This moment on the cross reflects the deep anguish and sense of abandonment that Jesus experienced during his crucifixion. The fulfillment of this prophecy in the New Testament highlights the connection between the suffering of Christ and the words of the psalmist, emphasizing the depth of Jesus' sacrifice for humanity.

[Matthew 27:39-44](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.27.39-44.ESV) ESV says: "And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, 'You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.' So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, 'He saved others; he cannot save himself

[John 19:28](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.19.28.ESV) ESV says: "After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), 'I thirst.'"

[Matthew 27:35-36](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.27.35-36.ESV) ESV says: "And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. Then they sat down and kept watch over him there."

Posterity

The Hebrew word "worm" in [Psalm 22:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.22.6.ESV) means "crimson worm" or "scarlet worm" and refers to a type of insect that was used in ancient times to produce a red dye. This imagery is significant because it symbolizes suffering and humiliation, as the psalmist describes himself as being "scorned by mankind and despised by the people." The reference to the "worm" highlights the depth of the psalmist's anguish and his sense of being utterly forsaken. 

Is it true that in the hebrew bible the word for worm in psalm 22:6 means crimson worm or scarlet worm?Yes, in the Hebrew Bible, the word used for "worm" in [Psalm 22:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.22.6.ESV) is "tola'at," which specifically refers to the crimson worm or scarlet worm. Are there any places that this same word was used in the bible? enumerate them all:
- [Exodus 16:31](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EXO.16.31.ESV) - The Israelites called the bread "manna," which was described as being like coriander seed and tasting like wafers made with honey. The manna was said to have a color similar to the "tola'at" (crimson worm).
- [Numbers 21:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/NUM.21.6.ESV) - The Lord sent "tola'at" (fiery serpents) among the Israelites as a punishment for their complaints. These serpents bit the people, causing many to die.
- [1 Kings 10:14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1KI.10.14.ESV) - The annual tribute of King Solomon included 666 talents
Yes, the word "tola'at" (crimson worm) is also mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in [Isaiah 1:18](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.1.18.ESV), where it is used metaphorically to describe the purification of sins: "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool." This usage emphasizes the transformative power of God's forgiveness and cleansing.


describes how bystanders mocked Jesus while he was on the cross, challenging him to save himself if he truly was the Son of God. This passage illustrates the scorn and derision that Jesus endured during his crucifixion, fulfilling the prophetic elements found in Psalm 22, which speaks of being mocked and scorned by others. The fulfillment of this prophecy in the New Testament underscores the depth of Jesus' suffering and the rejection he faced from those around him.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Prophetic Precision**: Both Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22 contain remarkably specific details that were fulfilled literally in Christ's crucifixion, written centuries before crucifixion was even invented by the Romans.

2. **Complementary Perspectives**: 
   - Isaiah 53 focuses more on the **theological significance** (substitutionary atonement)
   - Psalm 22 provides more **physical and emotional details** of the suffering

3. **Historical Context**: Psalm 22 was likely written by David around 1000 BC, and Isaiah 53 around 700 BC, both predicting details of Roman crucifixion methods that wouldn't be developed until centuries later.

4. **Jesus' Identification**: By quoting Psalm 22:1 on the cross, Jesus was directing people to read the entire psalm, which moves from suffering (vv. 1-21) to victory and worldwide worship (vv. 22-31).
