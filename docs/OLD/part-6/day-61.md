# Nehemiah's Leadership: Walls Rebuilt

**Day:** 61

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - Rebuilding the city walls

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Nehemiah, serving as cupbearer to the Persian king, receives permission to return and rebuild Jerusalem's walls. Despite fierce opposition, the walls are completed in 52 days through prayer, planning, and persistent work.
 - [Nehemiah 1:1–13:31](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/NEH.1.ESV) (History)
 - [Psalm 127:1](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.127.1.ESV) (Poetry)
 - [Ephesians 2:14-22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EPH.2.14-22.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [1 Corinthians 16:13](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1CO.16.13.ESV) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** The rebuilt walls represent security and restored dignity for God's people. Nehemiah's leadership style of combining prayer with action provides a model for godly leadership. The physical restoration prepares for spiritual restoration through the coming Messiah.

**Connecting the Dots:** Nehemiah records the remarkable wall-building project and ongoing reforms. Psalm 127 emphasizes that without God's blessing, human efforts are futile. Ephesians speaks of Christ breaking down dividing walls. Paul encourages standing firm in the work.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Prayer and Action:** Spiritual and practical work go together
- **Persistent Opposition:** God's work always faces resistance
- **Unified Effort:** Great achievements require community cooperation
- **Walls of Protection:** God provides security for His people

**Study Questions:**
1. How did Nehemiah combine prayer with practical planning and action?
2. What strategies did he use to overcome opposition to the work?
3. How do physical restoration and spiritual renewal connect?
