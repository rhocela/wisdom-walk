# Assyrian Threat: The Northern Kingdom Falls

**Day:** 51

**Chronological Setting:** Samaria - Assyria conquers the northern kingdom

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** The Assyrian Empire systematically conquers the northern kingdom of Israel, culminating in the fall of Samaria in 722 BC. The ten tribes are deported and largely disappear from history, fulfilling prophetic warnings about persistent apostasy.
 - [2 Kings 15:1–17:41](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2KI.15.ESV) (History)
 - [Isaiah 7:1–8:22, 10:5-19](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.7.ESV) (Prophecy)
 - [Hosea 1:1–14:9](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/HOS.1.ESV) (Prophecy)
 - [Romans 9:25-29](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.9.25-29.ESV) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** The northern kingdom's destruction demonstrates God's justice in judgment while showing His mercy in preserving a remnant. The prophets use Israel's unfaithfulness as a metaphor for spiritual adultery, pointing to the need for a new covenant.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Kings chronicles the final kings and Assyrian conquest. Isaiah speaks both judgment and hope during this crisis. Hosea uses his marriage as a living parable of God's relationship with unfaithful Israel. Paul explains how God calls those who were "not my people" to become His people.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Justice:** Persistent rebellion brings inevitable judgment
- **Prophetic Warning:** God gives multiple opportunities for repentance
- **Covenant Marriage:** God's relationship with His people pictured as marriage
- **Remnant Preservation:** God always saves some who remain faithful

**Study Questions:**
1. What lessons does the northern kingdom's fall teach about spiritual compromise?
2. How does Hosea's marriage illustrate God's relationship with His people?
3. What hope does the concept of a faithful remnant provide?
