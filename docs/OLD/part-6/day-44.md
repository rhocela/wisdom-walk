# Temple Built: God's House Among His People

**Day:** 44

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - Construction and dedication of Solomon's Temple

**Readings:**
 - [1 Kings 5:1–8:66](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1KI.5.ESV) (History)
 - [2 Chronicles 2:1–7:22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CH.2.ESV) (History)
 - [Song of Songs 1:1–8:14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/SNG.1.ESV) (Poetry)
 - [Ephesians 2:19-22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EPH.2.19-22.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [1 Peter 2:4-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1PE.2.4-10.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Solomon fulfills David's dream by building the temple in Jerusalem. The magnificent structure becomes the center of Israel's worship and the dwelling place of God's glory among His people. During this golden age, Solomon also pens the Song of Songs, celebrating the beauty of love and marriage as a reflection of God's covenant relationship with His people.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The temple represents God's desire to dwell with His people and establishes patterns of worship that point to Christ. The Song of Songs illustrates the intimate love relationship between God and His people, prefiguring Christ's love for His bride, the church. The ultimate temple is the New Jerusalem where perfect union is achieved.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Kings and Chronicles detail the temple's construction and dedication with God's glory filling it. Song of Songs celebrates love and covenant commitment, reflecting God's relationship with Israel and Christ's with the church. Ephesians describes the church as God's temple built on Christ. Peter calls believers living stones being built into a spiritual house.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Presence:** God desires to dwell among His people
- **Sacred Architecture:** Physical structures pointing to spiritual realities
- **Covenant Love:** Marriage as a picture of God's relationship with His people
- **Worship Centralized:** One place for the nation to meet with God
- **Typological Fulfillment:** Temple points to Christ and the church

**Study Questions:**
1. What did the temple represent about God's relationship with His people?
2. How does the Song of Songs illustrate God's love for His people?
3. How are believers today God's temple?
4. What does it mean to be "living stones" in God's spiritual house?
