**Historical Context:** The story of Cain and Abel establishes the pattern of two approaches to worship - one accepted by God, one rejected. This first instance of murder reveals how quickly sin escalates and how jealousy destroys relationships. The introduction of Seth shows God's faithfulness in preserving the godly line despite tragedy.

**Redemptive Significance:** The contrast between Cain and Abel illustrates the difference between false religion and true faith. Abel's acceptable sacrifice points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. The preservation of the godly line through Seth ensures the continuation of those who call upon the name of the Lord.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis 4 tells the story of the first brothers and their different approaches to worship, establishing the pattern of two ways. Hebrews explains that Abel's sacrifice was accepted because of faith. 1 John uses Cain's account to teach about love versus hatred among believers. 2 John and 3 John continue the Johannine themes of love, truth, and walking in Christian fellowship, warning against false teachers while encouraging hospitality toward faithful ministers. Jude warns against following "the way of Cain." Romans calls for acceptable worship through presenting our bodies as living sacrifices.
 
**Theological Threads:**

- **Christian Hospitality:** Supporting faithful ministers vs. opposing false teachers (3 John)
- **Johannine Fellowship:** The pattern of love established from the beginning
- **Godly Line Preserved:** Seth continues the faithful lineage
- **Blood That Speaks:** Abel's blood cries out, foreshadowing Christ's blood
