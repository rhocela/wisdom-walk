# Passover Night: The Blood of the Lamb

**Day:** 23

**Chronological Setting:** Egypt - The night of deliverance through blood sacrifice

**Readings:**
 - [Exodus 12:1–13:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EXO.12.1-13.16.ESV) (Narrative)
 - [1 Corinthians 5:7-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1CO.5.7-8.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [1 Peter 1:18-19](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1PE.1.18-19.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [John 1:29](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.1.29.ESV) (Gospel)
 - [Revelation 5:6-12](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.5.6-12.ESV) (Prophecy)

**Historical Context:** God institutes the Passover as the final plague strikes Egypt's firstborn. Only houses marked with lamb's blood are spared. This night of deliverance becomes Israel's most significant redemptive event.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The Passover lamb prefigures Christ as the ultimate sacrifice. Just as the lamb's blood protected from death, Christ's blood delivers from eternal judgment. The Passover becomes the foundation for understanding Christ's work.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus establishes the Passover institution and its meaning. Paul identifies Christ as our Passover lamb. Peter describes redemption through Christ's precious blood. John records the Baptist's declaration of Jesus as "the Lamb of God." Revelation celebrates the Lamb who was slain.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Substitutionary Sacrifice:** The lamb dies in place of the firstborn
- **Blood Redemption:** Deliverance through sacrificial death
- **Typological Fulfillment:** Passover lamb points to Christ
- **Eternal Salvation:** Temporal deliverance pictures eternal redemption

**Study Questions:**
1. How does the Passover lamb point to Jesus Christ?
2. What does it mean that Christ is your Passover lamb?
3. How should the Passover shape your understanding of salvation?
