# Golden Calf: The Broken Covenant

**Day:** 27

**Chronological Setting:** Mount Sinai - Israel's apostasy while Moses receives the law

**Readings:**
 - [Exodus 32:1–34:35](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EXO.32.1-34.35.ESV) (Narrative)
 - [1 Corinthians 10:6-14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1CO.10.6-14.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Acts 7:39-43](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ACT.7.39-43.ESV) (History)
 - [Romans 1:21-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.1.21-25.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** While Moses is on the mountain receiving God's law, Israel creates and worships a golden calf. This act of idolatry breaks the newly established covenant and results in severe judgment.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The golden calf incident reveals the depth of human sinfulness and the tendency to create God in our own image. It also demonstrates God's mercy in providing renewal after judgment.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus tells the complete story of apostasy and restoration. Paul uses this as a warning against idolatry and presumption. Stephen includes it in his indictment of Israel's rebellious history. Romans describes the general human tendency to exchange God's glory for images.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Human Depravity:** Quick turn to idolatry despite experiencing God's power
- **Covenant Breaking:** Violation brings serious consequences
- **Divine Mercy:** God provides opportunity for renewal
- **Intercessory Prayer:** Moses' intercession saves the people

**Study Questions:**
1. What does the golden calf incident teach about human nature?
2. How do you create "golden calves" in your own life?
3. What does Moses' intercession reveal about God's mercy?
