# Revelation: The Throne & the Lamb

**Day:** 95

**Chronological Setting:** Heaven - John's vision of worship and redemption

**Readings:**
- [Revelation 4:1–5:14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.4.ESV) (Apocalypse)
- [Isaiah 6:1-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.6.1-8.ESV) (Prophecy)
- [Exodus 25:10-22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EXO.25.10-22.ESV) (Narrative)
- [John 1:29-34](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.1.29-34.ESV) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** John is taken up to heaven and sees God's throne surrounded by worship. The Lamb, who was slain, is declared worthy to open the scroll and receive honor, glory, and power.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The vision centers on God's sovereignty and Christ's redemptive work. The Lamb's worthiness is the foundation for hope and worship, fulfilling God's promises of salvation.

**Connecting the Dots:** Revelation reveals heavenly worship. Isaiah sees God's glory. Exodus describes the mercy seat. John identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Sovereignty of God:** God reigns over all creation
- **Worthy Lamb:** Christ's sacrifice is central to redemption
- **Heavenly Worship:** All creation joins in praise
- **Fulfillment of Promise:** God's plan accomplished in Christ

**Study Questions:**
