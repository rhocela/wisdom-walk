# Stephen and Saul: Death and Transformation

**Day:** 79

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem and Damascus road - Stephen's martyrdom and Saul's conversion

**Readings:**
- [Acts 6:8–9:31](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ACT.6.8-9.31.ESV) (History)
- [Galatians 1:11-24](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GAL.1.11-24.ESV) (Epistle)
- [Daniel 7:13-14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/DAN.7.13-14.ESV) (Prophecy)
- [Luke 23:34, 46](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/LUK.23.34.ESV) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Stephen becomes the first Christian martyr, dying for his bold testimony before the Sanhedrin. Saul's conversion demonstrates God's sovereign grace and provides the church with its most effective apostle to the Gentiles.

**Connecting the Dots:** Acts records both Stephen's death and Saul's conversion. Galatians provides Paul's personal account of his calling. Daniel's vision of the Son of Man appears to Stephen. Luke shows Jesus' forgiving spirit that Stephen emulates.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Faithful Witness:** Willingness to die for the gospel truth
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God works through persecution to advance His purposes
- **Transforming Grace:** The worst sinner can become the greatest saint
- **Gospel Expansion:** Suffering spreads rather than stops the message

**Study Questions:**
1. What can we learn from Stephen's response to persecution?
2. How does Saul's conversion demonstrate God's grace and sovereignty?
3. How does persecution actually advance the gospel's spread?
