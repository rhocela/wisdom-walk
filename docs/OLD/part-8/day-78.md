# Ascension and Pentecost: The Spirit Comes

**Day:** 78

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - Jesus' ascension and the Spirit's arrival

**Readings:**
- [Acts 1:1–2:47](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ACT.1.1-2.47.ESV) (History)
- [Ephesians 4:7-16](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EPH.4.7-16.ESV) (Epistle)
- [Joel 2:28-32](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JOL.2.28-32.ESV) (Prophecy)
- [John 14:16-26](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.14.16-26.ESV) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** After forty days of post-resurrection appearances, Jesus ascends to heaven and promises the Holy Spirit's coming. The Spirit's arrival fulfills Old Testament prophecy and empowers believers to be witnesses to the ends of the earth.

**Connecting the Dots:** Acts records the historical events of ascension and Pentecost. Ephesians explains the ascended Christ's gifts to the church. Joel's prophecy finds fulfillment at Pentecost. John records Jesus' promise of the Spirit's coming.
