**Historical Context:** John the Baptist appears in the wilderness, calling Israel to repentance and baptizing those who respond. His witness to Jesus as the "Lamb of God" introduces the sacrificial theme central to the gospel. Jesus' baptism inaugurates His public ministry and receives divine endorsement.

**Connecting the Dots:** All four Gospels record John's ministry and Jesus' baptism, showing its crucial importance. Matthew emphasizes fulfillment of prophecy. Mark begins his Gospel with John's ministry. Luke provides historical context. John records the Baptist's testimony about Jesus' identity.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:** John fulfills the "Elijah to come" prophecy
- **Repentance Preparation:** Hearts must be prepared for the gospel
- **Divine Testimony:** God's voice confirms Jesus' identity at baptism
