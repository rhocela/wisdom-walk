# Divine Judgment: The Flood

**Day:** 6

**Chronological Setting:** Pre-flood world - God's judgment on universal corruption

**Readings:**
- Genesis 6:1â€“8:22 (Narrative)
- 2 Peter 2:4-10 (Epistle)
- 2 Peter 3:3-7 (Epistle)
- Matthew 24:37-39 (Gospel)
- 1 Peter 3:18-22 (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** The pre-flood world became so corrupt that God determined to destroy it while preserving a righteous remnant through Noah. This represents the first global judgment in biblical history.

**Redemptive Significance:** The flood demonstrates both God's holy judgment against sin and His gracious provision for salvation. It establishes the pattern of salvation through judgment that culminates in the cross.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis provides the detailed account of the flood judgment and salvation through the ark. 2 Peter uses the flood as proof of God's ability to judge the wicked while rescuing the righteous, and as a pattern for future judgment. Matthew records Jesus using the flood as a warning about His second coming. 1 Peter connects Noah's salvation through water to baptism.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Divine Judgment:** God's holy response to sin
- **Righteous Remnant:** God preserves the faithful few
- **Salvation Through Judgment:** Mercy within wrath
- **Covenant Faithfulness:** God remembers His promises
