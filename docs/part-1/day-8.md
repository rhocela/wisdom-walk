# Scattered Nations: Babel's Pride

**Day:** 8

**Chronological Setting:** Early post-flood period - humanity's proud rebellion

**Readings:**
- Genesis 10:1â€“11:9 (Narrative)
- Acts 17:26-27 (Narrative)
- 1 Corinthians 1:20-31 (Epistle)
- Revelation 7:9-10 (Apocalyptic)

**Historical Context:** Instead of spreading across the earth as God commanded, humanity gathers to build a tower reaching to heaven, seeking to make a name for themselves. God confuses their language and scatters them.

**Redemptive Significance:** Babel represents humanity's persistent attempt to reach God through human achievement. God's scattering of the nations sets up the need for the gospel to go to all peoples, which is reversed at Pentecost.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis tells of Babel's pride and God's scattering of the nations. Acts explains that God determined the boundaries of nations so they might seek Him. 1 Corinthians contrasts human wisdom with God's wisdom. Revelation shows the ultimate gathering of scattered nations in worship.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Human Pride:** Attempt to reach God through achievement
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God controls the nations
- **Linguistic Diversity:** God creates different languages
- **Missionary Purpose:** Scattering leads to gospel spread
