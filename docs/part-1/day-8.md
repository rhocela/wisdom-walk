**Historical Context:** God remembered Noah and caused the flood waters to recede. After Noah's sacrifice, God made an unconditional covenant never again to destroy the earth by flood, establishing the rainbow as the eternal sign. This represents a new beginning for humanity with divine promises of stability.

**Redemptive Significance:** The flood's end demonstrates God's faithfulness to save the righteous and His commitment to continuing His redemptive plan. The covenant with Noah shows God's grace in restraining judgment and providing stability for creation. Noah's worship upon leaving the ark models proper response to God's salvation.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis 8-9 shows God's salvation of Noah and the establishment of the covenant with its rainbow sign. 2 Peter uses the flood as a pattern for future judgment and the promise of new heavens and earth. 1 Peter connects Noah's salvation through water to baptism and Christ's resurrection. Isaiah connects God's oath to Noah with His promise of unfailing love. Revelation shows the rainbow around God's throne as a symbol of covenant faithfulness.
