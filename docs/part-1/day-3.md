# Paradise Lost: The Fall

**Day:** 3

**Chronological Setting:** Eden - the first sin and its consequences

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 3:1-24](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.3.1-24.ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Romans 5:12-21](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.5.12-21.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [1 Corinthians 15:21-22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1CO.15.21-22.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Romans 8:20-22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.8.20-22.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** The Fall represents the catastrophic entry of sin into God's perfect creation. This single act of disobedience affects all of creation and necessitates redemption.

**Redemptive Significance:** The Fall explains why redemption is necessary and sets up the need for a Second Adam. It reveals the seriousness of sin and the scope of salvation required.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis records the historical fall into sin with its immediate consequences. Romans 5 explains the theological significance of Adam's sin affecting all humanity. 1 Corinthians contrasts Adam who brought death with Christ who brings life. Romans 8 describes how creation itself was subjected to futility because of the Fall.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Universal Sinfulness:** All have sinned through Adam
- **Death's Entry:** Sin brings death into the world
- **Creation's Groaning:** All creation affected by the Fall
- **Need for Redemption:** Sets up the necessity of salvation

**Study Questions:**
1. How does Adam's sin affect you personally?
2. What does the Fall teach us about the nature of sin?
3. How does understanding the Fall help you appreciate salvation?

Parallels between the adam and eve's temptation and christ's temptation in the wilderness:
Both Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and Jesus in the wilderness faced temptations that tested their obedience to God, but their responses highlight key differences in human nature and divine purpose.

1. **Source of Temptation:**
   - Adam and Eve were tempted by the serpent, a representation of Satan, who deceived them into doubting God's command.
   - Jesus was tempted directly by Satan, who challenged His identity and mission.
2. **Nature of Temptation:**
   - Adam and Eve were tempted with the desire for knowledge and autonomy, leading them to eat the forbidden fruit to become "like God."
   - Jesus was tempted with physical needs (turning stones to bread), power (kingdoms of the world), and testing God's protection (throwing Himself from the temple).
3. **Response to Temptation:**
   - Adam and Eve succumbed to temptation, disobeying God's command, which resulted in the Fall and the introduction of sin into the world.
   - Jesus resisted all temptations by quoting Scripture, demonstrating perfect obedience to God and fulfilling His role as the Second Adam who would bring redemption.  
4. **Consequences:**
   - The disobedience of Adam and Eve led to separation from God, death, and the curse on creation.
   - Jesus' victory over temptation affirmed His divine mission and paved the way for salvation and restoration for humanity.       

Parallels of the 3 types of temptation:
1. **Physical Temptation:**
   - Adam and Eve were tempted to satisfy their physical desires by eating the forbidden fruit.
   - Jesus was tempted to turn stones into bread to satisfy His hunger after fasting.
2. **Power Temptation:**
   - Adam and Eve were tempted by the prospect of gaining knowledge and becoming like God, which implied a desire for power and autonomy.
   - Jesus was tempted with all the kingdoms of the world, offered to Him if He would worship Satan, appealing to a desire for worldly power.
3. **Spiritual Temptation:**
   - Adam and Eve were tempted to doubt God's word and authority, leading them to question His goodness.
   - Jesus was tempted to test God's protection by throwing Himself from the temple, challenging God to prove His care for Him. 

All humanity is tempted in these three ways: physical desires, the lure of power, and spiritual doubts.
