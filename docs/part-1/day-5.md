# Two Lines: Cain and Seth

**Day:** 5

**Chronological Setting:** The first generation after Eden - diverging paths

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 4:1-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4%3A1-26&version=ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Hebrews 11:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A4&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [1 John 3:11-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A11-15&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Jude 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude+11&version=ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** The story of Cain and Abel establishes the pattern of two lines of humanity - those who walk with God and those who rebel against Him. This division continues throughout biblical history.

**Redemptive Significance:** The contrast between Cain and Abel illustrates the difference between false religion and true faith. It shows that redemption requires faith, not works.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis tells the original story of the two brothers and their different approaches to God. Hebrews explains that Abel's sacrifice was accepted because of faith. 1 John uses this account to teach about love versus hatred. Jude warns against following "the way of Cain."
 
**Theological Threads:**
- **Two Ways:** Path of faith versus path of rebellion
- **Worship Matters:** God cares about the heart behind the offering
- **Jealousy's Danger:** Envy leads to violence
- **Godly Line Preserved:** Seth continues the line of faith

**Study Questions:**
1. What made Abel's sacrifice acceptable and Cain's unacceptable?
2. How do you see the "two lines" throughout biblical history?
3. What warning does Cain's response give us about handling rejection?
