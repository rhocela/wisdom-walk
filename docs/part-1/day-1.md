# In the Beginning: God Creates

**Day:** 1

**When this Happened:** Before time began - the eternal Word creates

**Readings:**
 - [Psalm 33:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+33%3A6-9&version=ESV) (Poetry)
 - [John 1:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1-5&version=ESV) (Gospel)
 - [Colossians 1:15-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A15-17&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Hebrews 1:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A1-3&version=ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** This theme establishes the foundation of all reality - God as Creator and sustainer of everything that exists. The creation account reveals God's power, order, and purpose in bringing forth the universe.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Creation sets the stage for redemption by showing God's original design for perfect fellowship with humanity. The Word who creates is the same Word who becomes flesh to redeem.

**Connecting the Dots:** Genesis reveals the historical fact of creation by God's word. Psalm 33 celebrates the power of God's creative word. John identifies Jesus as the eternal Word through whom all things were made. Colossians shows Christ as the image of the invisible God and agent of creation. Hebrews describes the Son as the radiance of God's glory who sustains all things.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Creation by Word:** God speaks reality into existence
- **Divine Order:** Everything has its proper place and purpose  
- **Christological Focus:** Christ as agent of creation
- **Sovereign Power:** God's absolute authority over all existence

**Study Questions:**
1. How does understanding Christ as Creator change your view of Him?
2. What does creation reveal about God's character?
3. How should knowing you're created by God affect your daily life?
