# In the Beginning: God Creates

**Day:** 1

**When this Happened:** Before time began - the eternal Word creates

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 1:1–2:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A1-2%3A3) (Narrative)
 - [Psalm 33:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+33%3A6-9&version=ESV) (Poetry)
 - [John 1:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1-5&version=ESV) (Gospel)

 - [Hebrews 1:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1%3A1-3&version=ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** This theme establishes the foundation of all reality - God as Creator and sustainer of everything that exists. The creation account reveals God's power, order, and purpose in bringing forth the universe.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Creation sets the stage for redemption by showing God's original design for perfect fellowship with humanity. The Word who creates is the same Word who becomes flesh to redeem.

**Connecting the Dots:** Genesis reveals the historical fact of creation by God's word. Psalm 33 celebrates the power of God's creative word. John identifies Jesus as the eternal Word through whom all things were made. Colossians shows Christ as the image of the invisible God and agent of creation. Hebrews describes the Son as the radiance of God's glory who sustains all things.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Creation by Word:** God speaks reality into existence
- **Divine Order:** Everything has its proper place and purpose  
- **Christological Focus:** Christ as agent of creation
- **Sovereign Power:** God's absolute authority over all existence

**Study Questions:**

1. **How does understanding Christ as Creator change your view of Him?**

    <summary>💭 Thoughts</summary>

    It's made me realize that Christ really is everything. He's not just God who came to earth—he *is* one with God from the beginning. And honestly, his existence is beyond human comprehension. The oneness with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit, yet their distinctness—it's something I can't fully grasp.

    But what really strikes me is when Scripture says "all things were made through him and for him." He's at the center of it all. The beloved Son—the one God speaks of in Matthew 3:17: "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Creation itself exists for him.

2. **What does creation reveal about God's character?**

    <summary>💭 Thoughts</summary>

    Creation gives us glimpses of God's glory and magnificence. They say artists are as good as their work, and God's creation is magnificent. 

    The intricate design of the universe, the mystery of life, the splendor and grandeur of nature—they all point to a Creator who is powerful, wise, and purposeful. When I see a flower bloom, it's as if I'm seeing a form of life reflecting an aspect of God's beauty. Life itself praising its Maker. An ordinary flower by the roadside can't help but be beautiful, because it reflects the beauty of its Creator.

3. **How should knowing you're created by God affect your daily life?**

    <summary>💭 Thoughts</summary>

    If I'm created in the image of God, then I have the responsibility to bear his image—to reflect it to others. If an ordinary flower by the roadside can reflect the beauty of its Creator, I should reflect God's character in the best way I know how.

    Not only that, I should aspire to represent him better in my actions, words, and thoughts, and especially in the way I treat other people—both those who know him and those who don't.

4. **What does it mean that God created "good" things?**

**A Side Thought:**

    <details>
    <summary>On God, Gender, and Language</summary>

    Something's been on my mind: Scripture says male AND female reflect God's image (Genesis 1:27). This means God has characteristics of both masculinity and femininity. We inherit our characteristics from Him—not the other way around.

    Some people think God is only masculine or only feminine. Some assume the Bible refers to God as "he" just because of the patriarchal society during the time it was written. And yes, I believe that God transcends human gender categories. But here's what I wonder—could it be that when the Bible reveals him as "Father", we should honor that revelation rather than reshape it?

    I've noticed some churches avoid calling God "He" or "Father" to not offend people. But could it be that this does more harm than good? Could it be that we're denying how God chose to reveal himself in Scripture? 

    Maybe the real danger is shaping God in our image. We've had bad experiences with patriarchy—do we assume God's version of patriarchy must be bad too? But what if this keeps us preoccupied with ourselves instead of with God?

    Just a thought: He is not made in our image. We are made in HIS.
