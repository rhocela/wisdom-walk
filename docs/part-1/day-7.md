# Corruption and Judgment: The Flood Begins

**Day:** 7

**Chronological Setting:** Pre-flood world - God's judgment on universal corruption

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 6:1–7:24](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.6.1-7.24.ESV) (Narrative)
 - [2 Peter 2:4-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2PE.2.4-5.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Matthew 24:37-39](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.24.37-39.ESV) (Gospel)
 - [Romans 1:18-20](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.1.18-20.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** The pre-flood world became increasingly corrupt as the sons of God intermarried with the daughters of men, producing giants. Violence and wickedness filled the earth. God determined to destroy the world while preserving Noah and his family, who found grace in His eyes. The construction of the ark demonstrates both God's judgment and mercy.

**Redemptive Significance:** The flood demonstrates both God's holy judgment against sin and His gracious provision for salvation. Noah's righteousness and obedience in building the ark point forward to salvation by faith and obedience. The preservation of humanity and animals shows God's commitment to His creation.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis 6-7 provides the detailed account of the growing corruption and the beginning of the flood judgment. 2 Peter confirms that God judged the ancient world while saving Noah. Matthew records Jesus using the flood as a warning about His second coming and the need for readiness. Romans explains how God's wrath is revealed against human unrighteousness.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Divine Judgment:** God's holy response to persistent sin
- **Righteous Remnant:** God preserves the faithful few
- **Grace in Judgment:** Mercy provided even in wrath
- **Obedient Faith:** Noah's response to God's commands
- **Universal Corruption:** Sin affects all humanity
- **Divine Patience:** God's longsuffering before judgment
