**Historical Context:** After the flood, God makes an unconditional covenant with Noah and all creation, promising never again to destroy the earth by flood. The rainbow becomes the eternal sign of this covenant.

**Redemptive Significance:** This covenant shows God's grace in restraining judgment and His commitment to continue working through creation toward redemption. It guarantees the stability needed for the redemptive plan to unfold.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis records God's covenant with Noah and the rainbow sign. Isaiah connects God's oath to Noah with His promise of unfailing love. Ezekiel sees the rainbow around God's throne as a sign of His glory. Revelation shows the rainbow around God's throne and the mighty angel, symbolizing covenant faithfulness.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Unconditional Covenant:** Based on God's grace, not human performance
- **Universal Scope:** Includes all creation
- **Divine Restraint:** God limits His judgment
- **Covenant Signs:** Visible reminders of God's promises
