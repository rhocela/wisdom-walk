# First Promise: Hope in Darkness

**Day:** 4

**Chronological Setting:** Immediately after the Fall - God's first promise of redemption

**Readings:**
- Genesis 3:15, 21 (Narrative)
- Isaiah 7:14, 9:6-7 (Prophecy)
- Galatians 4:4-7 (Epistle)
- 1 John 3:8 (Epistle)
- Revelation 12:1-9 (Apocalyptic)

**Historical Context:** Even in pronouncing judgment for sin, God immediately provides hope through the first messianic promise. This protoevangelium becomes the foundation for all subsequent redemptive revelation.

**Redemptive Significance:** Genesis 3:15 is the first promise of a Redeemer who will defeat Satan and reverse the effects of the Fall. All of redemptive history flows from this initial promise.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis 3:15 contains the first promise of One who will defeat the serpent. Isaiah expands this with specific prophecies about the virgin birth and the child who will rule. Galatians explains the fulfillment in Christ's incarnation. 1 John describes Christ's mission to destroy the devil's work. Revelation depicts the cosmic conflict between the woman's offspring and the dragon.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Protoevangelium:** First gospel promise
- **Messianic Hope:** Promise of a coming Redeemer
- **Cosmic Conflict:** Spiritual warfare between God and Satan
- **Victory Assured:** The serpent's head will be crushed

**Study Questions:**
