# Babel's Pride: Scattered by God

**Day:** 10

**Chronological Setting:** Early post-flood period - humanity's prideful rebellion

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 11:1-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11%3A1-9&version=ESV) (Narrative)
 - [1 Corinthians 1:20-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+1%3A20-31&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Acts 2:1-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A1-12&version=ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Psalm 127:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+127%3A1&version=ESV) (Poetry)
 - [James 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4%3A6&version=ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Instead of spreading across the earth as God commanded, humanity gathered in the plain of Shinar to build a city and tower reaching to heaven. Their goal was to make a name for themselves and avoid being scattered. God confused their language and scattered them across the earth, demonstrating His sovereignty over human pride and plans.

**Redemptive Significance:** Babel represents humanity's persistent attempt to reach God through human achievement and self-glorification. God's scattering of the languages sets up the eventual reversal at Pentecost, where the gospel is proclaimed in many languages. This dispersion ensures that the gospel will eventually reach all peoples.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis 11 tells of Babel's pride and God's judgment through linguistic confusion and scattering. 1 Corinthians contrasts human wisdom and achievement with God's wisdom and power. Acts 2 shows the reversal of Babel at Pentecost when the gospel is proclaimed in many languages by the Holy Spirit's power. Psalm 127 reminds us that all human effort is futile without God's blessing. James warns that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Human Pride:** Attempt to reach God through self-achievement
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God frustrates human prideful plans
- **Linguistic Diversity:** God creates different languages as judgment
- **Gospel Preparation:** Scattering prepares for worldwide mission
- **Pentecost Reversal:** The Spirit reverses Babel's judgment
- **Humility vs. Pride:** God opposes pride but gives grace to the humble

**Study Questions:**
1. What was fundamentally wrong with humanity's plan at Babel?
2. How does God use the scattering of languages for His redemptive purposes?
3. What modern "towers of Babel" do you see in today's world?
4. How does Pentecost reverse and redeem the judgment at Babel?
5. What does this teach us about human achievement versus God's grace?
