# Nations Spread: Table of Nations

**Day:** 9

**Chronological Setting:** Early post-flood period - the spread of Noah's descendants

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 9:18–10:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+9%3A18-10%3A32&version=ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Acts 17:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17%3A26-27&version=ESV) (Narrative)

**Historical Context:** After the flood, Noah's three sons - Shem, Ham, and Japheth - became the fathers of all nations. Genesis 10 provides the "Table of Nations" showing how the earth was populated. The incident with Ham's disrespect toward Noah reveals character differences among the brothers. This genealogy traces the origin of various people groups and nations.

**Redemptive Significance:** The Table of Nations shows God's plan for all peoples to spread across the earth. It establishes the human diversity that will later hear the gospel message. The blessing and cursing of Noah's descendants sets up future redemptive history, including the line through which Messiah will come and the nations that will receive the gospel.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis 9-10 records the spread of nations from Noah's three sons and establishes the diversity of peoples. Acts explains that God determined the boundaries and times of nations so they might seek Him. Deuteronomy shows God's sovereignty in dividing the nations. Psalm 86 prophesies that all nations will worship God. Revelation shows the ultimate fulfillment with people from every nation worshipping before God's throne.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God controls the spread and boundaries of nations
- **Human Dignity:** All peoples descended from common ancestors
- **Missionary Purpose:** Nations spread to eventually hear the gospel
- **Blessing and Cursing:** Actions have generational consequences
- **Cultural Diversity:** God's design includes different peoples and languages
- **Universal Worship:** All nations will ultimately worship God
