**Historical Context:** Under Joshua's leadership, Israel crosses the Jordan River during flood season through another miracle. The crossing marks the end of wilderness wandering and the beginning of conquest of the Promised Land.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The Jordan crossing represents entering into God's rest and victory. It symbolizes the believer's transition from spiritual wandering to experiencing God's promises through faith in Christ.

**Connecting the Dots:** Joshua records the miraculous crossing and memorial stones. Psalm 114 celebrates both the Red Sea and Jordan crossings as demonstrations of God's power. Hebrews explains entering God's rest through faith. Colossians describes spiritual victory through union with Christ.

- **Faithful Leadership:** Joshua as a type of Christ leading God's people
- **Memorial Stones:** Importance of remembering God's mighty acts
- **Entering Rest:** Moving from wandering to possessing promises
- **Victory Through Faith:** Conquest requires trusting God's power
