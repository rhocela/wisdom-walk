# Samuel's Ministry: Transition to Monarchy

**Day:** 36

**When this Happened:** End of Judges period - Samuel as last judge and kingmaker

**Readings:**
- 1 Samuel 1:1–4:22, 7:2–8:22 (History)
- 1 Peter 2:4-6 (Epistle)
- Acts 13:20-22 (History)
- Psalm 99:6-7 (Poetry)

**Historical Context:** Samuel, born in answer to Hannah's prayer, serves as judge, priest, and prophet. His ministry marks the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy as Israel demands a king like other nations.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Samuel represents faithful leadership and the importance of listening to God's voice. His role in anointing kings points to Christ as the ultimate Prophet, Priest, and King. Israel's demand for a human king reflects rejection of God's kingship.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Samuel tells of Samuel's birth, calling, and ministry through Israel's demand for a king. Peter describes Christ as the chosen cornerstone that people often reject. Acts summarizes this transition period in Israel's history. The Psalm celebrates Samuel as one who called on God's name.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Faithful Leadership:** Samuel's example of integrity in ministry
- **Divine Calling:** God calls people from childhood for His service
- **Rejection of God's Rule:** Human tendency to prefer visible authority
- **Transition Periods:** God uses faithful servants in times of change

**Study Questions:**
1. What made Samuel an effective leader for God?
2. How do you hear and respond to God's voice like Samuel?
3. What are the dangers of preferring human authority over God's rule?
