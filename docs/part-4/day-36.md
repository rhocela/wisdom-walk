# Judges Raised: Cycles of Apostasy

**Day:** 36

**Chronological Setting:** Period of the Judges - Repeated cycles of sin and deliverance

**Readings:**
 - [Judges 2:6–3:31, 6:1–8:35](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JDG.2.6-3.31,6.1-8.35.ESV) (History)
 - [Romans 1:18-32](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.1.18-32.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [2 Chronicles 7:14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CH.7.14.ESV) (History)
 - [Psalm 106:34-46](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.106.34-46.ESV) (Poetry)

**Historical Context:** After Joshua's death, Israel enters a dark period characterized by cycles of apostasy, oppression, crying out to God, and deliverance through judges. This pattern repeats throughout the period, showing Israel's tendency toward spiritual decline.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The judges period reveals human nature's bent toward sin and the need for righteous leadership. It demonstrates God's patience and mercy in providing deliverers, prefiguring the ultimate Judge and Deliverer, Jesus Christ.

**Connecting the Dots:** Judges describes the cycles and some key deliverers like Gideon. Romans explains the pattern of human rebellion and its consequences. Chronicles offers God's promise of healing for repentant people. The Psalm recounts Israel's pattern of rebellion and God's mercy.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Human Depravity:** Tendency to turn from God without strong leadership
- **Divine Mercy:** God repeatedly provides deliverance despite rebellion
- **Cyclical History:** Patterns of sin, judgment, repentance, and restoration
- **Need for Perfect Leader:** Human judges fail; only Christ succeeds perfectly

**Study Questions:**
1. What patterns do you see in your own spiritual life that mirror Israel's cycles?
2. How does God's mercy in the judges period encourage you?
3. What makes Jesus different from the human judges?
