# Land Divided: Inheritance Received

**Day:** 33

**When this Happened:** Canaan - The Promised Land divided among the tribes

**Readings:**
- Joshua 13:1â€“21:45 (History)
- Ephesians 1:3-14 (Epistle)
- 1 Peter 1:3-5 (Epistle)
- Colossians 1:12-14 (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** After major victories, Joshua divides the Promised Land among the twelve tribes according to God's direction. Each tribe receives its inheritance, fulfilling God's ancient promise to Abraham about the land.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The inheritance of the land prefigures the spiritual inheritance believers receive in Christ. Just as each tribe had a specific portion, each believer has unique blessings and calling in God's kingdom.

**Connecting the Dots:** Joshua details the division of the land and establishment of cities of refuge. Ephesians describes the spiritual blessings and inheritance believers have in Christ. Peter speaks of the imperishable inheritance reserved in heaven. Colossians celebrates qualification for sharing in the saints' inheritance.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Inheritance:** God gives His people a portion and place
- **Individual Calling:** Each person/tribe has unique role and blessing
- **Secure Possession:** What God gives cannot be taken away
- **Present and Future:** Inheritance begun now, completed in eternity

**Study Questions:**
1. What does your inheritance in Christ include?
2. How is your calling unique within God's people?
3. What gives you confidence about your eternal inheritance?
