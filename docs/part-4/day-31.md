# Jericho Falls: Victory Through Obedience

**Day:** 31

**Chronological Setting:** Jericho - The first conquest in the Promised Land

**Readings:**
 - [Joshua 5:13–6:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+5%3A13-6%3A27&version=ESV) (History)
 - [Hebrews 11:30-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A30-31&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [2 Corinthians 10:3-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+10%3A3-5&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Ephesians 6:10-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A10-18&version=ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** God gives Israel victory over the fortified city of Jericho through an unusual strategy—marching around the city and shouting at God's command. The walls fall down flat, demonstrating that victory comes through obedience, not military might.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Jericho's fall illustrates that God's ways are not human ways. Victory comes through faith and obedience, not conventional wisdom. It pictures the spiritual warfare believers face and the power available through God.

**Connecting the Dots:** Joshua tells the complete story of Jericho's conquest. Hebrews credits faith for the walls falling down and Rahab's salvation. Paul teaches that spiritual warfare requires God's weapons, not human methods. Ephesians details the armor and weapons for spiritual battle.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Strategy:** God's ways differ from human wisdom
- **Faith and Obedience:** Victory requires trusting God's methods
- **Spiritual Warfare:** Battles are won in the spiritual realm first
- **God's Power:** Walls fall when God fights for His people

**Study Questions:**
1. How does Jericho's fall teach about trusting God's unconventional methods?
2. What "walls" in your life need God's intervention?
3. How do you apply spiritual warfare principles in daily life?
