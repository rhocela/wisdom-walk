# Ruth's Loyalty: Covenant Faithfulness

**Day:** 35

**When this Happened:** Time of the Judges - A story of loyalty and redemption

**Readings:**
- Ruth 1:1â€“4:22 (History)
- Matthew 1:5 (Gospel)
- Ephesians 2:11-22 (Epistle)
- 1 Peter 2:9-10 (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** During the dark period of the judges, the story of Ruth provides a bright spot of covenant loyalty. Ruth, a Moabite woman, demonstrates remarkable faithfulness to her Israelite mother-in-law Naomi and to Israel's God.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Ruth's inclusion in the genealogy of Christ demonstrates God's grace to Gentiles and His plan to include all nations in His redemptive purpose. Her story prefigures the church as the Gentile bride grafted into God's people.

**Connecting the Dots:** Ruth tells the complete story of loyalty, redemption, and restoration. Matthew includes Ruth in Jesus' genealogy. Ephesians explains how Gentiles are brought near through Christ. Peter describes the church as strangers who become God's people.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Covenant Loyalty:** Faithful love that endures despite circumstances
- **Gentile Inclusion:** God's plan always included all nations
- **Kinsman Redeemer:** Boaz prefigures Christ as our redeemer
- **Divine Providence:** God works through ordinary circumstances

**Study Questions:**
1. What does Ruth's loyalty teach about commitment in relationships?
2. How does Ruth's story give hope to outsiders seeking inclusion?
3. How does Boaz as kinsman-redeemer point to Christ?
