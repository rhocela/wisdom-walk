# Day 22: Endings and Beginnings

⏱️ *Estimated reading time: 17-20 minutes*

<ProgressTracker dayNumber={22} />

## Chronological Setting

We continue in the patriarchal period (approximately 2000-1500 BC) as we witness the conclusion of Abraham's remarkable life and the beginning of the next chapter in God's covenant plan. These events span from around 2025 BC (Abraham's remarriage to Keturah) to 1991 BC (the birth of Jacob and Esau when Isaac is 60). Abraham lives to age 175, dying around 1991 BC and seeing his covenant promises begin to multiply through Isaac's family. This passage marks the transition from Abraham's generation to Isaac's, showing God's faithfulness across generations.

## Historical Context

Abraham's marriage to **Keturah** after Sarah's death produces six more sons, demonstrating God's promise that Abraham would be **"the father of many nations."** However, Abraham carefully protects Isaac's inheritance by sending these other sons **"away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country"** with gifts, ensuring the covenant line remains clear.

The **20-year period of Rebekah's barrenness** parallels Sarah's experience, testing Isaac and Rebekah's faith while demonstrating that covenant children come through God's power, not human ability. Isaac's prayer for his wife and God's response show the importance of persistent faith in God's promises.

The **struggle between Jacob and Esau in the womb** is prophetic, representing the conflict between two nations and two different approaches to spiritual things. **Esau's** name means "hairy" while **Jacob's** means "heel-grabber" or "supplanter," both names proving significant for their life stories. The oracle that **"the older shall serve the younger"** reverses normal cultural expectations and demonstrates God's sovereign choice.

**Esau's sale of his birthright** for a bowl of stew reveals his character—he values immediate physical satisfaction over spiritual inheritance. This exchange establishes a pattern where Esau consistently chooses the temporal over the eternal, the physical over the spiritual.

## Redemptive Significance

Abraham's peaceful death at **175 years old**, **"breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years,"** demonstrates the blessing that comes with covenant faithfulness. His life span allows him to see God's promises beginning to multiply through Isaac's family, providing confirmation that God keeps His word across generations.

The **burial of Abraham by both Isaac and Ishmael** shows reconciliation between the separated brothers and honor for their father. Despite their different destinies, both sons unite to honor the man through whom God's blessing came to the world. This foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation that God will accomplish through Abraham's greater descendant, Christ.

The **birth of Jacob and Esau** introduces the theme of God's sovereign election that runs throughout Scripture. God's choice of Jacob **"before the children had been born or had done anything good or bad"** (Romans 9:11) demonstrates that salvation depends on God's grace, not human merit or effort.

**Esau's despising of his birthright** represents humanity's natural tendency to value temporary pleasures over eternal inheritance. His choice warns against the danger of trading spiritual blessings for momentary satisfaction—a pattern that leads to eternal loss.

## Connecting the Dots

**Romans 9:10-13** uses Jacob and Esau to illustrate God's sovereign election in salvation. Paul explains that God's choice was made **"before the children had been born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls."** This demonstrates that salvation comes through divine grace, not human achievement.

**Hebrews 12:16-17** warns Christians not to be like Esau—**"profane"** persons who trade spiritual inheritance for temporary satisfaction. The passage emphasizes that some choices, once made, cannot be reversed, even with **"tears"** of regret. This sobering warning challenges believers to value their spiritual inheritance above all earthly pleasures.

**Malachi 1:2-3** confirms God's sovereign choice: **"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."** This strong language emphasizes the eternal consequences of God's electing love and the importance of being among those whom God has chosen for His covenant purposes.

## Theological Threads

True faith thinks beyond one generation and takes practical steps to ensure God's promises continue.

- **Spiritual Values vs. Temporal Pleasures**: Esau's sale of his birthright for stew represents humanity's tendency to trade eternal blessings for temporary satisfaction. This choice pattern demonstrates the importance of developing spiritual discernment and eternal perspective.

- **Reconciliation and Honor**: Isaac and Ishmael's joint burial of Abraham shows how shared respect for godly parents can bridge family divisions. Even when families face difficult separations, honoring godly heritage can provide common ground for reconciliation.
