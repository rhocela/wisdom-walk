# Bondage Begins: Israel in Egypt

**Day:** 18

**When this Happened:** Egypt - From welcome guests to enslaved nation

**Readings:**
- Exodus 1:1â€“2:25 (Narrative)
- Acts 7:17-29 (History)
- Hebrews 11:23-29 (Epistle)
- Psalm 105:23-25 (Poetry)

**Historical Context:** After Joseph's death, a new Pharaoh who "knew not Joseph" enslaves the Israelites. Their population growth threatens Egyptian security, leading to oppression and infanticide. Moses is born and preserved during this dark period.

**God's Bigger Plan:** This bondage sets the stage for God's greatest Old Testament redemptive act. The oppression in Egypt becomes a type of humanity's bondage to sin, from which God will provide deliverance.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus describes the beginning of oppression and Moses' early life. Acts summarizes this period as part of God's plan. Hebrews celebrates the faith of Moses' parents and Moses himself. Psalm 105 shows how God allowed this situation to develop His people.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God allows trials to accomplish His purposes
- **Faithful Preservation:** God protects His people in danger
- **Preparation for Deliverance:** Bondage creates longing for freedom
- **Covenant Remembrance:** God remembers His promises to Abraham

**Study Questions:**
1. Why did God allow His people to become enslaved in Egypt?
2. How does this bondage parallel humanity's slavery to sin?
3. What does Moses' preservation teach about God's protection?
