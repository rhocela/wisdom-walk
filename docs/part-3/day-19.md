# The Burning Bush: Divine Calling

**Day:** 19

**When This Happened:** Mount Horeb - God calls Moses to deliver Israel

**Readings:**
- Exodus 3:1â€“4:31 (Narrative)
- Acts 7:30-35 (History)
- Hebrews 11:24-27 (Epistle)
- Mark 12:26-27 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** After forty years in Midian, Moses encounters God in a burning bush. God reveals His covenant name (Yahweh) and commissions Moses to deliver Israel from Egyptian bondage.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The burning bush revelation establishes God's covenant name and demonstrates His nature as the eternal, unchanging God who acts in history to save His people. This calling parallels God's call to all believers for His service.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus details God's call and Moses' reluctant acceptance. Acts emphasizes Moses as a type of Christ, rejected by his people but appointed by God as deliverer. Hebrews commends Moses' faith in choosing God's people over Egyptian privilege. Jesus uses God's self-revelation to Moses to prove the resurrection.

**Key Truths:**
- **Divine Self-Revelation:** God reveals His covenant name and nature
- **Reluctant Calling:** God uses unlikely instruments
- **Holy Ground:** Divine presence sanctifies ordinary places
- **Covenant Faithfulness:** God remembers His promises

**Study Questions:**
1. What does God's self-revelation as "I AM" mean for your relationship with Him?
2. How do Moses' excuses reflect your own reluctance to serve God?
3. Where has God met you on "holy ground"?
