# Wilderness Testing: Manna and Water

**Day:** 23

**When this Happened:** Wilderness of Sin and Rephidim - God provides for physical needs

**Readings:**
 - [Exodus 16:1â€“17:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+16%3A1-17%3A7&version=ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Numbers 11:4-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+11%3A4-9&version=ESV) (Law)
 - [John 6:25-58](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A25-58&version=ESV) (Gospel)
 - [1 Corinthians 10:3-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10%3A3-4&version=ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** In the wilderness, Israel faces hunger and thirst. God provides manna from heaven and water from the rock, testing their faith and teaching dependence on Him for daily needs.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The manna prefigures Christ as the bread of life who came down from heaven. The water from the rock represents Christ as the source of living water for spiritual thirst.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus describes God's provision and Israel's complaints. Numbers gives details about the manna. Jesus uses the manna to teach about Himself as the true bread from heaven. Paul identifies Christ as the spiritual rock that provided water.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Provision:** God supplies all physical and spiritual needs
- **Daily Dependence:** Learning to trust God one day at a time
- **Christ Prefigured:** Manna and water point to Jesus
- **Testing Faith:** Trials reveal the heart's true condition

**Study Questions:**
1. How do the manna and water point to your need for Christ?
2. What does daily gathering of manna teach about trusting God?
3. How do you respond when God's provision doesn't match your preferences?
