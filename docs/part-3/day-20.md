# Signs and Wonders: Confronting Pharaoh

**Day:** 20

**When this Happened:** Egypt - The ten plagues demonstrate God's power

**Readings:**
 - [Exodus 5:1â€“11:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+5%3A1-11%3A10&version=ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Psalm 78:42-51](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+78%3A42-51&version=ESV) (Poetry)
 - [Romans 9:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9%3A17-18&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Revelation 16:1-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+16%3A1-21&version=ESV) (Prophecy)

**Historical Context:** Moses and Aaron confront Pharaoh with God's demand to release Israel. Pharaoh's hardened heart leads to ten escalating plagues that demonstrate God's power over Egyptian gods and creation itself.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The plagues reveal God's supreme power over all false gods and human authority. They prefigure the final judgments described in Revelation and demonstrate God's commitment to deliver His people.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus narrates the confrontation and plagues. Psalm 78 recounts God's wonders in Egypt as part of Israel's history. Romans uses Pharaoh to illustrate God's sovereignty in judgment. Revelation shows similar plagues in the final judgment.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Supremacy:** God's power over false gods and human authority
- **Hardened Hearts:** Resistance to God leads to judgment
- **Progressive Judgment:** Escalating consequences for rebellion
- **Covenant Protection:** God's people preserved in judgment

**Study Questions:**
1. What do the plagues teach about God's power over false gods?
2. How does Pharaoh's hardened heart warn about resisting God?
3. How do you see God's protection of His people during judgment?
