# Day 20: Death, Faith, and Future Hope

⏱️ *Estimated reading time: 15-18 minutes*

<ProgressTracker dayNumber={20} />

## Chronological Setting

We continue in the patriarchal period (approximately 2000-1500 BC) as Abraham faces the greatest personal loss of his journey—the death of Sarah, his beloved wife and partner in faith for over sixty years. These events occur around 2029 BC when Sarah dies at age 127, making Abraham about 137 years old. This chapter marks a transition in Abraham's life from the active years of covenant building to the final phase of preparing for the next generation. Despite his grief, Abraham's actions demonstrate unwavering faith in God's promises about the land.

## Historical Context

**Sarah's death at age 127** makes her the only woman in Scripture whose age at death is recorded, emphasizing her crucial role in God's covenant plan. As the mother of the promised son and the first matriarch of the covenant people, her death marks the end of an era. The detailed account of her burial arrangements reveals important aspects of Abraham's faith and his relationship with the surrounding peoples.

**Kiriath-arba** (later called Hebron) was a significant Canaanite city, and Abraham's request to purchase burial ground there demonstrates his continued status as a **"sojourner and foreigner"** despite decades of residence. The **Hittites'** respectful treatment of Abraham as a **"prince of God"** shows how his faith and character had earned him honor among the local peoples.

The **cave of Machpelah** becomes the first piece of the promised land that Abraham actually owns. This purchase is significant because it represents Abraham's concrete expression of faith in God's promise that his descendants would inherit this land. By insisting on paying the full price rather than accepting it as a gift, Abraham establishes legitimate legal ownership and demonstrates that God's promises are worth any cost.

## Redemptive Significance

Abraham's careful burial of Sarah reveals his faith in the **resurrection and future inheritance**. By purchasing a permanent burial place in the promised land, Abraham demonstrated his belief that death is not the end and that God's promises extend beyond this life. This act of faith declares that he and Sarah would somehow participate in the future fulfillment of God's covenant promises.

The **cave of Machpelah** becomes a symbol of hope in God's faithfulness across generations. Here Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah would all be buried, creating a physical monument to God's covenant promises. Each burial at Machpelah would serve as a reminder that God's people are citizens of a heavenly country, temporarily dwelling on earth but destined for eternal inheritance.

Abraham's willingness to pay **400 shekels of silver** for the burial site demonstrates that God's promises have infinite value. Despite being offered the land as a gift, Abraham insists on purchasing it at full price, showing that participation in God's covenant plan is worth any sacrifice. This prefigures the ultimate price that God would pay through His Son's death to secure our eternal inheritance.

## Connecting the Dots

**Hebrews 11:13-16** explicitly connects Abraham's burial of Sarah to the broader theme of faith's perspective on earthly pilgrimage. The patriarchs **"acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth"** and were **"seeking a homeland"**—not their earthly country of origin, but **"a better country, that is, a heavenly one."** Their faith looked beyond temporal circumstances to eternal realities.

**Paul's teaching in 2 Corinthians 5:1-8** echoes Abraham's perspective, describing our earthly bodies as temporary **"tents"** while we await **"a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."** Like Abraham purchasing burial ground in faith, Paul encourages believers to live with confidence in our eternal inheritance, even when facing death.

The **resurrection hope** expressed in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 fulfills what Abraham believed by faith when he buried Sarah. Paul assures believers that **"those who have died in Christ"** will rise first when Jesus returns, and **"we will always be with the Lord."** Abraham's faith in future resurrection finds its ultimate validation in Christ's victory over death.

## Theological Threads

- **Faith Beyond Death**: Abraham's careful burial arrangements for Sarah demonstrate faith that looks beyond death to resurrection and eternal inheritance. True faith believes in God's promises even when circumstances seem to contradict them, including the ultimate contradiction of death.

- **Pilgrimage Perspective**: Abraham's status as a **"sojourner and foreigner"** who must purchase burial ground reveals the Christian understanding of earthly life as temporary residence. We are citizens of heaven, temporarily dwelling on earth while awaiting our eternal inheritance.

- **Costly Commitment**: Abraham's insistence on paying full price for the burial site shows that participation in God's covenant plan requires sacrificial commitment. God's promises are of infinite value and worth any earthly cost we might pay to secure them.

- **Generational Faithfulness**: By establishing a family burial place in the promised land, Abraham creates a tangible reminder of God's promises for future generations. This demonstrates how faith should build bridges to the future, ensuring that God's covenant purposes continue across generations.
