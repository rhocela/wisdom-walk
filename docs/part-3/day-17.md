**Historical Context:** Famine forces Jacob's sons to come to Egypt for grain, not knowing their brother Joseph is the ruler they must approach. Joseph tests them before revealing his identity and extending forgiveness.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Joseph's forgiveness prefigures the greater forgiveness offered through Christ. His statement "you meant evil... but God meant it for good" becomes a model for understanding how God redeems suffering.

**Connecting the Dots:** Genesis details the full story of reconciliation and forgiveness. Jesus teaches the necessity of forgiveness in the Lord's Prayer. Paul instructs believers not to take revenge but to overcome evil with good. Both Ephesians and Colossians command forgiveness as Christ has forgiven us.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Redemption:** God turns evil intentions for good
- **Gracious Forgiveness:** Extending mercy despite suffering
- **Family Restoration:** Broken relationships healed
- **Providential Purpose:** Understanding God's plan in retrospect

**Study Questions:**
1. What enabled Joseph to forgive such devastating betrayal?
2. How does Joseph's forgiveness point to Christ's forgiveness?
3. Who in your life needs the kind of forgiveness Joseph offered?
