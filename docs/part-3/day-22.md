# Red Sea Crossing: Victory Through Water

**Day:** 22

**When This Happened:** Red Sea - Miraculous deliverance from Egyptian pursuit

**Readings:**
- Exodus 14:1â€“15:21 (Narrative)
- 1 Corinthians 10:1-4 (Epistle)
- Hebrews 11:29 (Epistle)
- Psalm 106:7-12 (Poetry)

**Historical Context:** Trapped between the Red Sea and Pharaoh's army, Israel experiences God's miraculous deliverance. The sea parts, allowing Israel to cross on dry ground, then returns to destroy the Egyptian forces.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The Red Sea crossing represents complete deliverance from bondage. Paul sees it as a type of baptism, symbolizing death to the old life and resurrection to new life in Christ.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus records the miracle and Moses' song of victory. Paul interprets the crossing as baptism and warns against presumption. Hebrews highlights the faith required to cross. The Psalm recounts God's wonders but notes Israel's quick forgetfulness.

**Key Truths:**
- **Complete Deliverance:** No partial salvation, full rescue from bondage
- **Baptismal Symbolism:** Death to old life, resurrection to new
- **Divine Warrior:** God fights for His people
- **Victory Celebration:** Appropriate response to God's salvation

**Study Questions:**
1. How does the Red Sea crossing picture your salvation experience?
2. What does it mean that God "fights for you"?
3. How should deliverance lead to worship and celebration?
