# Levitical System: Priesthood and Sacrifice

**Day:** 27

**When This Happened:** Mount Sinai - Establishing the priesthood and sacrificial system

**Readings:**
- Leviticus 1:1–10:20, 16:1-34 (Law)
- Hebrews 7:1–10:18 (Epistle)
- 1 Peter 2:4-10 (Epistle)
- Revelation 1:5-6 (Prophecy)

**Historical Context:** God establishes the Levitical priesthood and sacrificial system to provide a way for sinful people to approach a holy God. The elaborate system of offerings and the Day of Atonement address different aspects of human sinfulness.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The entire Levitical system points to Christ as the perfect High Priest who offered Himself as the ultimate sacrifice. It teaches that sin requires death but that God provides a substitute.

**Connecting the Dots:** Leviticus establishes the sacrificial system and priesthood. Hebrews extensively explains how Christ fulfills and supersedes the Levitical system. Peter describes believers as a royal priesthood. Revelation celebrates Christ making believers priests to God.

**Key Truths:**
- **Substitutionary Atonement:** Life for life, blood for blood
- **Priestly Mediation:** Need for mediator between God and humanity
- **Perfect Sacrifice:** Christ as the ultimate offering
- **Believer's Priesthood:** Direct access to God through Christ

**Study Questions:**
1. What do the various offerings teach about the nature of sin?
2. How does Christ fulfill the role of both priest and sacrifice?
3. What does it mean to be part of a "royal priesthood"?
