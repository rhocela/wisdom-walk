# Mount Sinai: The Law Given

**Day:** 26

**Chronological Setting:** Mount Sinai - God gives the law to establish covenant relationship

**Readings:**
 - [Exodus 19:1–24:18](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EXO.19.1-24.18.ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Deuteronomy 5:1-33](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/DEU.5.1-33.ESV) (Law)
 - [Galatians 3:19-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GAL.3.19-25.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Hebrews 12:18-24](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/HEB.12.18-24.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Three months after leaving Egypt, Israel arrives at Mount Sinai where God establishes His covenant with the nation. The giving of the law, including the Ten Commandments, defines Israel's relationship with God.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The law reveals God's holiness and human sinfulness, serving as a tutor to lead people to Christ. While it cannot save, it prepares hearts for the gospel by showing the need for a Savior.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus narrates the giving of the law with thunder and lightning. Deuteronomy retells the commandments for the new generation. Galatians explains the law's purpose as a guardian until Christ came. Hebrews contrasts Mount Sinai's terror with Mount Zion's grace.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Holiness:** God's moral perfection revealed in law
- **Covenant Relationship:** Law defines terms of relationship with God
- **Human Sinfulness:** Law reveals inability to meet God's standards
- **Preparation for Grace:** Law as tutor leading to Christ

**Study Questions:**
1. What does the law reveal about God's character and human nature?
2. How does the law serve as a "tutor" to lead you to Christ?
3. What is the difference between law and grace in your relationship with God?
