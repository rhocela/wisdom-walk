# The Tabernacle: God's Dwelling Place

**Day:** 26

**When this Happened:** Mount Sinai - Instructions for and construction of the tabernacle

**Readings:**
- Exodus 25:1–31:18, 35:1–40:38 (Narrative)
- Hebrews 8:1-6, 9:1-14 (Epistle)
- John 1:14 (Gospel)
- Revelation 21:3 (Prophecy)

**Historical Context:** God provides detailed instructions for constructing the tabernacle, a portable sanctuary where He will dwell among His people. Every detail has symbolic significance pointing to God's holiness and the way of approach to Him.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The tabernacle prefigures Christ who "tabernacled among us" and the ultimate dwelling of God with His people in the new creation. It establishes patterns of worship and sacrifice that find fulfillment in Christ.

**Connecting the Dots:** Exodus gives the detailed instructions and construction account. Hebrews explains that the earthly tabernacle was a copy of heavenly realities, fulfilled in Christ's ministry. John declares that the Word became flesh and "tabernacled" among us. Revelation promises God will dwell with His people forever.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Presence:** God desires to dwell with His people
- **Sacred Space:** Holiness requires proper approach to God
- **Typological Fulfillment:** Tabernacle points to Christ and heaven
- **Sacrificial System:** Blood required for approach to God

**Study Questions:**
1. What does the tabernacle teach about God's desire to dwell with people?
2. How does the tabernacle point to Jesus Christ?
3. What does it mean that your body is now God's temple?
