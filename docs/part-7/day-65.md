# Silent Years: Waiting for Messiah

**Day:** 65

**When this Happened:** Intertestamental period - Preparation for Christ's coming

**Readings:**
 - [Malachi 3:1â€“4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+3%3A1-4%3A6) (Prophecy)
 - [Isaiah 9:1-7, 53:1-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9%3A1-7%2C+53%3A1-12) (Prophecy)
 - [Luke 1:5-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A5-25) (Gospel)
 - [Galatians 4:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4%3A4-5) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** After Malachi, prophetic revelation ceases for 400 years as God's people wait for the promised Messiah. During this time, various empires rule over the Jews while they maintain their faith and study the Scriptures, preparing for the fulfillment of messianic prophecies.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The silent years demonstrate God's perfect timing and preparation for Christ's coming. The absence of prophetic voice heightens expectation for the final Prophet, while political and cultural developments prepare the world for the gospel's spread.

**Connecting the Dots:** Malachi ends with promise of Elijah's return before the "great and terrible day." Isaiah provides detailed messianic prophecies. Luke begins the New Testament story with Zechariah's vision. Paul explains that Christ came at exactly the right time.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Timing:** God acts at precisely the right moment in history
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:** Old Testament promises find completion in Christ
- **Heightened Expectation:** Silence increases longing for God's voice
- **Universal Preparation:** World conditions prepared for gospel spread

**Study Questions:**
1. Why did God allow 400 years of prophetic silence?
2. How did the intertestamental period prepare for Christ's coming?
3. What does God's timing teach about His sovereignty and wisdom?
