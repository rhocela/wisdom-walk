**Historical Context:** God calls Abraham to leave his homeland and family to go to a land He will show him. This begins God's plan to create a chosen people through whom all nations will be blessed.

**Redemptive Significance:** Abraham's call marks the beginning of salvation history through a chosen people. His faith-response becomes the model for all who would follow God, making him the father of all believers.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis records God's call and Abraham's obedient response. Acts confirms this calling happened while Abraham was still in Mesopotamia. Hebrews emphasizes the faith required to leave without knowing the destination. Romans explains how Abraham's faith makes him father of all believers.
