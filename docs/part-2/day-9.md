# Day 9: The Call of Faith

⏱️ *Estimated reading time: 18-22 minutes*

<ProgressTracker dayNumber={9} />

## Chronological Setting

We transition from the primeval history (Genesis 1-11) to the patriarchal period (approximately 2000-1500 BC) as God shifts from dealing with all humanity to calling one man through whom He will bless all nations. Abraham's call marks the beginning of salvation history—God's particular plan to redeem the world through a chosen family that will become the people of Israel. This pivotal moment around 2000 BC launches the covenant relationship that will culminate in Christ.

## Historical Context

**Abraham** (originally Abram) lived in **Ur of the Chaldeans**, a sophisticated city in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). Archaeological evidence reveals Ur as a major center of commerce, learning, and idol worship, particularly devoted to the moon god Nanna. God's call required Abraham to leave not just a geographic location, but an entire worldview and religious system.

The **land of Canaan** that God promises was strategically located at the crossroads of three continents—Africa, Asia, and Europe. This positioning would allow Abraham's descendants to influence the entire ancient world. When Abraham arrived, Canaan was populated by various tribes (Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, etc.) who practiced fertility religions and child sacrifice, demonstrating the spiritual darkness God planned to dispel through His covenant people.

## Redemptive Significance

Abraham's call represents God's **gracious initiative** in human redemption. After the scattering at Babel, God could have abandoned humanity to their rebellion. Instead, He chose to work through one man and his family to restore the blessing that was lost in Eden. This calling demonstrates that salvation always begins with God's sovereign choice, not human merit or seeking.

The **threefold promise** to Abraham—land, descendants, and blessing to all nations—establishes the foundation for all subsequent revelation. The promise of **land** anticipates the earthly inheritance of Israel and ultimately the new heaven and earth. The promise of **descendants** points to both the physical nation of Israel and the spiritual children of faith. The promise that **"all families of the earth shall be blessed"** through Abraham finds its fulfillment in Christ, who brings salvation to every tribe, tongue, and nation.

## Connecting the Dots

**Romans 4** reveals that Abraham is the **"father of all who believe"**—both Jews and Gentiles who share his faith. His righteousness came not through works or ritual, but through **trusting God's promise**, establishing the principle that **"the righteous shall live by faith"** (Romans 1:17). This faith-righteousness anticipates justification through Christ.

**Galatians 3:16** identifies the **"seed"** promised to Abraham as ultimately referring to **Christ Himself**: "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, 'And to offsprings,' referring to many, but referring to one, 'And to your offspring,' who is Christ." Jesus is both the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and the means by which that blessing reaches all nations.

The **altar** Abraham builds at Shechem (Genesis 12:7) establishes the pattern of worship that will characterize the covenant people. This act of worship in response to God's promise prefigures how the gospel call always results in transformed lives that honor God through worship and obedience.

## Theological Threads

- **Divine Election and Grace**: God's call of Abraham demonstrates divine sovereignty in salvation—God chooses whom He will save according to His gracious purposes, not human merit. This election serves redemptive purposes, as Abraham is chosen to be a blessing to all nations.

- **Faith as Right Relationship**: Abraham's example establishes that right relationship with God comes through faith, not works. His willingness to leave everything based solely on God's word demonstrates the nature of saving faith—trust that acts on God's promises even when circumstances seem contrary.

- **Covenant Faithfulness**: God's promises to Abraham establish the covenant relationship that will govern all subsequent revelation. Divine faithfulness to these promises, even when human partners fail, demonstrates God's unchanging commitment to His redemptive purposes.

- **Universal Mission Through Particular Calling**: God's choice of one man serves His love for all humanity. Particular election serves universal purposes—through Abraham's family, God will bless all the families of the earth, demonstrating how God's specific callings advance His global mission.

## Study Questions

1. **Divine Calling**: What did God's call require Abraham to leave behind, and what did it require him to trust? How does Abraham's experience help us understand what it means for God to call us today?

2. **Faith and Obedience**: Abraham went out "not knowing where he was going" (Hebrews 11:8). What does his example teach us about the relationship between faith and obedience when God's calling seems unclear or difficult?

3. **Promise and Fulfillment**: How do the three promises God made to Abraham (land, descendants, blessing to all nations) find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ? What does this teach us about how God keeps His promises across generations?

4. **Blessing Through Election**: God chose Abraham to be a blessing to all nations, not just to be blessed himself. How should understanding our own election or calling motivate us toward mission and service to others?

5. **Faith Versus Sight**: Abraham left a prosperous city for an unknown land, trusting only God's word. What "Ur" might God be calling you to leave? What promises of God do you need to trust more fully, even when you can't see the outcome?
