**Day:** 13

**Chronological Setting:** Mount Moriah - The ultimate test of Abraham's faith

 - [James 2:21-24](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JAS.2.21-24.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Hebrews 11:17-19](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/HEB.11.17-19.ESV) (Epistle)

 - [Romans 8:32](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.8.32.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** God tests Abraham by commanding him to sacrifice Isaac, the son of promise. Abraham's willingness to obey, even to the point of raising the knife, demonstrates perfect faith.

**Redemptive Significance:** This event prefigures God's sacrifice of His own Son. Abraham's willingness to give up Isaac mirrors God the Father's willingness to give up Jesus. Isaac carrying the wood parallels Christ carrying His cross.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis records the test and Abraham's obedience. James shows that Abraham's faith was demonstrated by his works. Hebrews explains that Abraham believed God could raise Isaac from the dead. John records Jesus saying Abraham saw His day and rejoiced. Romans connects God's not sparing His own Son to Abraham's experience.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Faith Demonstrated:** True faith evidenced by actions
- **Divine Testing:** God proves the genuineness of faith
- **Substitutionary Sacrifice:** God provides a substitute
- **Typological Fulfillment:** Isaac prefigures Christ

**Study Questions:**
1. What does Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac teach about genuine faith?
2. How do you see Jesus in this story?
3. What "Isaac" might God be asking you to surrender?
