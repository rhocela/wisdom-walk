# Covenant Making: Divine Promises

**Day:** 12

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 12:10–13:18, 15:1-21](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.12.10-13.18,15.1-21.ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Romans 4:13-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.4.13-25.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Galatians 3:6-18](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GAL.3.6-18.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Despite Abraham's failures (lying about Sarah in Egypt), God reaffirms His promises and establishes a formal covenant. The promise includes land, descendants, and blessing to all nations.

**Redemptive Significance:** This covenant becomes the foundation of all God's redemptive work. It's based on faith, not works, making it the prototype of the gospel and establishing the principle of justification by faith.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis shows God's covenant promises to Abraham despite his failures. Romans explains that the promise came through faith, not law, making Abraham father of all who believe. Galatians argues that the law cannot nullify the covenant of promise. Hebrews emphasizes God's oath as our anchor of hope.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Unconditional Promise:** Based on God's grace, not human performance
- **Justification by Faith:** Righteousness credited through belief
- **Covenant Continuity:** Promise extends to spiritual descendants
- **Divine Oath:** God swears by Himself to guarantee the promise

**Study Questions:**
1. How do Abraham's failures reveal the nature of God's grace?
2. What does it mean that you are Abraham's spiritual descendant?
3. How does God's covenant with Abraham give you assurance?
