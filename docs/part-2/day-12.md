# Promise Passed: Isaac's Story

**Chronological Setting:** Isaac's life - The promised son and his descendants

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 23:1â€“28:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+23%3A1-28%3A9&version=ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Romans 9:6-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9%3A6-13&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Hebrews 11:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A20&version=ESV) (Epistle)
 - [Galatians 4:21-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4%3A21-31&version=ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Isaac represents the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham. His life includes finding a wife (Rebekah), the birth of twins (Jacob and Esau), and the passing of the blessing to the next generation.

**Redemptive Significance:** Isaac embodies the principle of promise versus works. He is the child of promise, not of natural ability. His life demonstrates God's sovereign choice in continuing the line of redemption.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis tells Isaac's complete story from Sarah's death through Jacob's departure. Romans uses Isaac to illustrate God's sovereign election and the principle that not all physical descendants are children of promise. Hebrews notes Isaac's faith in blessing his sons. Galatians uses Isaac as a symbol of freedom versus bondage.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Promise Fulfilled:** God keeps His word to Abraham
- **Divine Election:** God's sovereign choice continues the line
- **Child of Promise:** Born through God's power, not human ability
- **Covenant Continuity:** Blessing passes to the next generation

**Study Questions:**
1. How does Isaac's birth demonstrate God's faithfulness?
2. What does Isaac's story teach about God's sovereign choice?
3. How are believers today "children of promise" like Isaac?
