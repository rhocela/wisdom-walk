**Historical Context:** Joseph, Jacob's favored son, receives dreams indicating future leadership. His brothers' jealousy leads to his sale into slavery in Egypt. Despite setbacks including false accusation and imprisonment, God prepares him for leadership through Pharaoh's dreams.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Joseph's suffering and elevation prefigure Christ's path to glory through suffering. His position saving Egypt and his family demonstrates how God uses apparent disasters to accomplish His redemptive purposes for His people.

**Connecting the Dots:** Genesis tells the complete story of Joseph's rise through adversity. Psalm 105 celebrates how God used Joseph's trials to preserve His people. Romans assures believers that God works all things together for good. Peter encourages believers that trials refine faith like gold.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God controls circumstances for His purposes
- **Suffering and Preparation:** Trials prepare for greater service
- **Dreams and Revelation:** God reveals His plans through various means
- **Faith Through Adversity:** Maintaining trust despite circumstances
