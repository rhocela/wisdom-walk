# Wrestling with God: Jacob's Transformation

**Chronological Setting:** Peniel - Jacob's night of wrestling and transformation

**Readings:**
- Genesis 28:10â€“35:29 (Narrative)
- Hosea 12:3-6 (Prophecy)
- Romans 9:25-26 (Epistle)
- 1 Peter 2:9-10 (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** After years of exile and God's discipline, Jacob returns to face Esau. The night before their meeting, he wrestles with God and emerges transformed, receiving the new name Israel.

**Redemptive Significance:** Jacob's transformation from deceiver to Israel (prince with God) illustrates the spiritual transformation God works in His people. His new name becomes the name of God's chosen nation.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis details Jacob's entire journey from his dream at Bethel through his transformation at Peniel. Hosea reflects on Jacob's wrestling with God and his spiritual victory. Romans uses Hosea's language about calling those "not my people" to be "my people." Peter applies this to the church as God's chosen people.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Divine Discipline:** God shapes character through trials
- **Spiritual Wrestling:** Persistent prayer and surrender
- **Identity Transformation:** From Jacob (deceiver) to Israel (prince)
- **Covenant Community:** Individual becomes nation
