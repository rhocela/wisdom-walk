# Testing Brothers: Character and Repentance

**Day:** 18

**Chronological Setting:** Egypt - Joseph tests his brothers during the famine

**Readings:**
 - [Genesis 42:1–44:34](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.42.1-44.34.ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Psalm 139:23-24](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.139.23-24.ESV) (Poetry)
 - [2 Corinthians 7:8-11](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CO.7.8-11.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [James 1:2-4](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JAS.1.2-4.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Famine forces Joseph's brothers to come to Egypt for grain. Not recognizing Joseph as the ruler, they face his tests designed to reveal whether they have genuinely repented of their past cruelty, particularly their treatment of Benjamin and their father Jacob.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Joseph's testing mirrors how God tests His people - not to discover their character but to reveal and refine it. The brothers' transformation from jealous sons to protective family members shows the power of genuine repentance.

**Connecting the Dots:** Genesis details Joseph's careful testing of his brothers' hearts. The Psalm expresses desire for God to search and test our hearts. Paul explains how godly sorrow leads to repentance without regret. James teaches that testing produces character and maturity.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Heart Examination:** God tests to reveal and refine character
- **True Repentance:** Genuine change shown through actions
- **Family Restoration:** Broken relationships require healing process
- **Protective Love:** Mature love protects the vulnerable

**Study Questions:**
1. Why did Joseph test his brothers instead of immediately revealing himself?
2. What evidence shows that the brothers had genuinely changed?
3. How does God test our character today?
4. What does this teach about the process of reconciliation?
5. How can we show protective love like Judah demonstrated for Benjamin?
