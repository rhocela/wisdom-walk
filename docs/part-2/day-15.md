**Historical Context:** Favoritism creates jealousy among Jacob's sons, leading to the betrayal and sale of Joseph. Meanwhile, Judah's moral failure with Tamar shows the depth of family dysfunction.

**Redemptive Significance:** God's redemptive plan continues despite human failure. From Judah's sinful union with Tamar comes Perez, an ancestor of Jesus. God weaves even family dysfunction into His sovereign plan.

**Why These Passages Connect:** Genesis shows the family dysfunction and its consequences. Paul explains that God chooses the weak and despised to accomplish His purposes. Matthew includes Tamar in Jesus' genealogy. Romans declares that God works all things together for good.

**Theological Threads:**
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God's plan advances despite human failure
- **Redemptive Grace:** Sin and dysfunction cannot thwart God's purposes
- **Unlikely Heroes:** God uses flawed people in His plan
- **Family Legacy:** Actions affect future generations

**Study Questions:**
