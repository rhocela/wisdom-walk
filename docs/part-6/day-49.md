# Elisha's Double Portion: Miracles of Mercy

**Day:** 49

**Chronological Setting:** Northern Israel - Elisha's ministry following Elijah

**Readings:**
 - [2 Kings 2:1–8:15](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2KI.2.ESV) (History)
 - [2 Kings 13:14-21](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2KI.13.14-21.ESV) (History)
 - [Jonah 1:1–4:11](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JON.1.ESV) (Narrative)
 - [Luke 4:24-27](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/LUK.4.24-27.ESV) (Gospel)
 - [John 14:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.14.12.ESV) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Elisha receives a double portion of Elijah's spirit and performs twice as many recorded miracles. His ministry focuses more on acts of mercy and healing than judgment, demonstrating God's compassion even in a time of apostasy. During this same period, God sends Jonah to Nineveh, showing that His mercy extends even to Israel's enemies when they repent.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Elisha's miracles of provision, healing, and resurrection prefigure Christ's ministry and demonstrate God's power over death, disease, and material need. Jonah's mission to Nineveh reveals God's heart for all nations and prefigures the gospel going to the Gentiles. Both ministries show God's mercy extending beyond Israel's boundaries.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Kings records Elisha's extensive miracle ministry. Jonah demonstrates God's compassion for repentant enemies and prefigures Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. Jesus references Elisha's ministry to Naaman as an example of God's grace to Gentiles. Jesus promises that His followers will do even greater works through the Spirit.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Merciful Ministry:** God's power displayed in compassionate acts
- **Universal Mission:** God's love extends to all nations, even enemies
- **Prefiguring Christ:** Elisha's miracles and Jonah's experience point forward to Jesus
- **Divine Provision:** God meets practical needs of His people
- **Reluctant Obedience:** God uses imperfect servants for His purposes

**Study Questions:**
1. How do Elisha's miracles point forward to Jesus' ministry?
2. What does Jonah's story teach about God's mercy toward enemies?
3. How does Elisha's healing of Naaman demonstrate God's grace to outsiders?
4. What does Jonah's three days in the fish prefigure about Christ?
