# Elisha's Double Portion: Miracles of Mercy

**Day:** 49

**When this Happened:** Northern Israel - Elisha's ministry following Elijah

**Readings:**
- 2 Kings 2:1â€“8:15 (History)
- 2 Kings 13:14-21 (History)
- Luke 4:24-27 (Gospel)
- John 14:12 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Elisha receives a double portion of Elijah's spirit and performs twice as many recorded miracles. His ministry focuses more on acts of mercy and healing than judgment, demonstrating God's compassion even in a time of apostasy.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Elisha's miracles of provision, healing, and resurrection prefigure Christ's ministry and demonstrate God's power over death, disease, and material need. His ministry shows God's heart of mercy toward suffering people.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Kings records Elisha's extensive miracle ministry. Jesus references Elisha's ministry to Naaman as an example of God's grace to Gentiles. Jesus promises that His followers will do even greater works through the Spirit.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Merciful Ministry:** God's power displayed in compassionate acts
- **Prefiguring Christ:** Elisha's miracles point forward to Jesus
- **Divine Provision:** God meets practical needs of His people
- **Universal Grace:** God's mercy extends beyond ethnic boundaries

**Study Questions:**
1. How do Elisha's miracles point forward to Jesus' ministry?
2. What do these stories teach about God's care for practical needs?
3. How does Elisha's healing of Naaman demonstrate God's grace to outsiders?
