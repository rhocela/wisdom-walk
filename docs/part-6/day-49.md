# Elisha's Double Portion: Miracles of Mercy

**Day:** 49

**Chronological Setting:** Northern Israel - Elisha's ministry following Elijah

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Elisha receives a double portion of Elijah's spirit and performs twice as many recorded miracles. His ministry focuses more on acts of mercy and healing than judgment, demonstrating God's compassion even in a time of apostasy.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Elisha's miracles of provision, healing, and resurrection prefigure Christ's ministry and demonstrate God's power over death, disease, and material need. His ministry shows God's heart of mercy toward suffering people.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Kings records Elisha's extensive miracle ministry. Jesus references Elisha's ministry to Naaman as an example of God's grace to Gentiles. Jesus promises that His followers will do even greater works through the Spirit.
