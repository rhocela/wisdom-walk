# Josiah's Reform: The Last Revival

**Day:** 54

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - Josiah's reign and discovery of the Law

**Readings:**
 - [2 Kings 22:1–23:30](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2KI.22.ESV) (History)
 - [2 Chronicles 34:1–35:27](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CH.34.ESV) (History)
 - [Nahum 1:1–3:19](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/NAM.1.ESV) (Prophecy)
 - [Zephaniah 1:1–3:20](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ZEP.1.ESV) (Prophecy)
 - [2 Timothy 3:16-17](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2TI.3.16-17.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Young King Josiah leads Judah's final great revival after the Book of the Law is discovered during temple repairs. His reforms include destroying idols, celebrating Passover, and renewing the covenant, but come too late to prevent God's predetermined judgment. During this period, prophets like Nahum announce Nineveh's coming destruction and Zephaniah calls for repentance before the Day of the Lord.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Josiah's revival demonstrates the power of God's Word to transform individuals and societies, while Nahum reveals that God's justice will ultimately triumph over evil empires. Both show that divine judgment is certain but can be delayed by repentance. The reforms show the proper response to Scripture's authority.

**Connecting the Dots:** The historical accounts detail Josiah's comprehensive reforms and covenant renewal. Nahum prophesies Nineveh's destruction, vindicating God's justice after their earlier repentance under Jonah. Zephaniah prophesies during this period, calling for repentance while announcing coming judgment. Paul teaches about Scripture's power to transform and equip for good works.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Word-Centered Revival:** Scripture discovery leads to spiritual transformation
- **Divine Justice:** God's judgment against evil is certain and complete
- **Too Little, Too Late:** Some consequences cannot be reversed by reform
- **Individual vs. Corporate:** Personal righteousness amid national judgment
- **Covenant Renewal:** Rediscovering and recommitting to God's terms

**Study Questions:**
1. What made Josiah's response to finding the Law so exemplary?
2. How does Nahum's prophecy about Nineveh demonstrate God's justice?
3. Why couldn't even Josiah's sincere reforms prevent Judah's judgment?
4. How does God's Word function as a catalyst for spiritual revival?
