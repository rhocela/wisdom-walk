# Josiah's Reform: The Last Revival

**Day:** 54

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - Josiah's reign and discovery of the Law

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Young King Josiah leads Judah's final great revival after the Book of the Law is discovered during temple repairs. His reforms include destroying idols, celebrating Passover, and renewing the covenant, but come too late to prevent God's predetermined judgment.
 - [2 Kings 22:1–23:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+22%3A1-23%3A30) (History)
 - [2 Chronicles 34:1–35:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+34%3A1-35%3A27) (History)
 - [Zephaniah 1:1–3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zephaniah+1%3A1-3%3A20) (Prophecy)
 - [2 Timothy 3:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A16-17) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** Josiah's revival demonstrates the power of God's Word to transform individuals and societies. His passionate response to Scripture shows the proper attitude toward divine revelation, while his tragic death reveals that even sincere reform cannot always reverse judgment.

**Connecting the Dots:** The historical accounts detail Josiah's comprehensive reforms and covenant renewal. Zephaniah prophesies during this period, calling for repentance while announcing coming judgment. Paul teaches about Scripture's power to transform and equip for good works.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Word-Centered Revival:** Scripture discovery leads to spiritual transformation
- **Too Little, Too Late:** Some consequences cannot be reversed by reform
- **Individual vs. Corporate:** Personal righteousness amid national judgment
- **Covenant Renewal:** Rediscovering and recommitting to God's terms

**Study Questions:**
1. What made Josiah's response to finding the Law so exemplary?
2. Why couldn't even Josiah's sincere reforms prevent Judah's judgment?
3. How does God's Word function as a catalyst for spiritual revival?
