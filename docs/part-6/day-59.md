# Return Begins: First Wave Under Zerubbabel

**Day:** 59

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - The first return from exile

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Under Zerubbabel's leadership, nearly 50,000 exiles return to Jerusalem and begin rebuilding the temple. Opposition from local inhabitants slows the work, requiring prophetic encouragement from Haggai and Zechariah to complete the project.
 - [Ezra 2:1–6:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+2%3A1-6%3A22) (History)
 - [Haggai 1:1–2:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Haggai+1%3A1-2%3A23) (Prophecy)
 - [Zechariah 1:1–8:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+1%3A1-8%3A23) (Prophecy)
 - [1 Corinthians 3:10-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A10-15) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** The temple rebuilding represents renewed relationship with God and restoration of proper worship. Though smaller than Solomon's temple, it represents hope for God's continued presence with His people and points toward the ultimate temple not made with hands.

**Connecting the Dots:** Ezra chronicles the return and temple rebuilding. Haggai challenges the people to prioritize God's house over their own comfort. Zechariah provides encouragement through visions of future glory. Paul teaches about building with lasting materials.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Restoration Begins:** God fulfills His promise to bring His people home
- **Worship Priority:** God's house deserves first attention and best efforts
- **Prophetic Encouragement:** God sends messengers to motivate His people
- **Foundation Building:** Present work prepares for future glory

**Study Questions:**
1. What obstacles did the returning exiles face in rebuilding?
2. How did the prophets Haggai and Zechariah encourage the builders?
3. What does it mean to build with "gold, silver, and precious stones"?
