# Exile in Babylon: Learning in a Foreign Land

**Day:** 57

**Chronological Setting:** Babylon - Life among the exiles

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** The Jewish exiles in Babylon must learn to live faithfully in a pagan culture while maintaining their identity as God's people. Some, like Daniel and his friends, rise to positions of influence while refusing to compromise their faith.
 - [Daniel 1:1–6:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1%3A1-6%3A28) (Narrative)
 - [Ezekiel 33:1–48:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+33%3A1-48%3A35) (Prophecy)
 - [Psalm 137:1-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+137%3A1-9) (Poetry)
 - [1 Peter 2:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A11-12) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** The exile experience teaches that God's people can remain faithful anywhere and that God's sovereignty extends over all nations. It prepares them for the later reality of living as aliens and strangers in the world while awaiting their true homeland.

**Connecting the Dots:** Daniel shows faithful living in exile and God's sovereignty over pagan empires. Ezekiel provides hope through visions of restoration and the new temple. Psalm 137 expresses the pain of exile and longing for home. Peter teaches about living as exiles in this world.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Faithful Exile:** Maintaining identity while living in foreign culture
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God rules over all nations and empires
- **Cultural Engagement:** Serving faithfully without compromising convictions
- **Homesickness for Zion:** Longing for God's presence and promises

**Study Questions:**
1. How did Daniel and his friends maintain faithfulness in Babylon?
2. What does the exile teach about God's sovereignty over nations?
3. How do believers today live as "exiles" in this world?
