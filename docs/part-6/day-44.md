# Temple Built: God's House Among His People

**Day:** 44

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - Construction and dedication of Solomon's Temple

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Solomon fulfills David's dream by building the temple in Jerusalem. The magnificent structure becomes the center of Israel's worship and the dwelling place of God's glory among His people.
 - [1 Kings 5:1–8:66 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+5%3A1-8%3A66)
 - [2 Chronicles 2:1–7:22 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+2%3A1-7%3A22)
 - [Ephesians 2:19-22 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A19-22)
 - [1 Peter 2:4-10 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A4-10)

**God's Bigger Plan:** The temple represents God's desire to dwell with His people and establishes patterns of worship that point to Christ. The New Testament reveals that believers themselves become God's temple, and the ultimate temple is the New Jerusalem.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Kings and Chronicles detail the temple's construction and dedication with God's glory filling it. Ephesians describes the church as God's temple built on Christ. Peter calls believers living stones being built into a spiritual house.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Presence:** God desires to dwell among His people
- **Sacred Architecture:** Physical structures pointing to spiritual realities
- **Worship Centralized:** One place for the nation to meet with God
- **Typological Fulfillment:** Temple points to Christ and the church

**Study Questions:**
1. What did the temple represent about God's relationship with His people?
2. How are believers today God's temple?
3. What does it mean to be "living stones" in God's spiritual house?
