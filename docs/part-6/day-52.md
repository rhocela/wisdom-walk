# Hezekiah's Revival: Reform and Deliverance

**Day:** 52

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - Hezekiah's reign and Assyrian siege

**Readings:**
- 2 Kings 18:1–20:21 (History)
- 2 Chronicles 29:1–32:33 (History)
- Isaiah 36:1–39:8 (Prophecy)
- Hebrews 11:33-34 (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** King Hezekiah leads Judah's greatest spiritual revival, cleansing the temple, celebrating Passover, and destroying idols. When Assyria threatens Jerusalem, God miraculously delivers the city in response to Hezekiah's prayer and Isaiah's prophecy.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Hezekiah's revival demonstrates the power of wholehearted commitment to God and the importance of proper worship. God's deliverance of Jerusalem prefigures His ultimate deliverance of His people and shows that no enemy can overcome those who trust in Him.

**Connecting the Dots:** The historical accounts detail Hezekiah's reforms and God's miraculous deliverance. Isaiah provides the prophetic perspective on these events. Hebrews commends those who "through faith conquered kingdoms" and "escaped the edge of the sword."

****Theological Threads:****
- **Wholehearted Revival:** Complete commitment brings God's blessing
- **Prayer and Deliverance:** Desperate prayer moves God to act
- **Prophetic Ministry:** God's word through prophets guides and encourages
- **Divine Protection:** God shields those who trust in Him

**Study Questions:**
1. What made Hezekiah's revival so effective and comprehensive?
2. How did prayer and prophecy work together in Jerusalem's deliverance?
3. What does this teach about trusting God when facing overwhelming odds?
