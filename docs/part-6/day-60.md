# Ezra's Return: The Law Restored

**Day:** 60

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - Ezra's mission to teach the Law

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Nearly 80 years after the first return, Ezra the scribe leads another group back to Jerusalem with authority to teach God's law. His ministry focuses on spiritual renewal through Scripture study and dealing with the problem of intermarriage with pagans.
 - [Ezra 7:1–10:44](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EZR.7.ESV) (History) 
 - [Nehemiah 8:1-18](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/NEH.8.1-18.ESV) (History)
 - [Malachi 1:1–4:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAL.1.ESV) (Prophecy)
 - [2 Timothy 4:2](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2TI.4.2.ESV) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** Ezra's emphasis on God's Word demonstrates the centrality of Scripture in spiritual renewal. His reforms prepare the people for the coming of the Messiah by establishing proper understanding of God's law and covenant requirements.

**Connecting the Dots:** Ezra details the scribe's mission and reforms. Nehemiah 8 shows the powerful response when the Law is read and explained. Malachi addresses the spiritual issues Ezra encountered. Paul emphasizes the importance of preaching the Word.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Word-Centered Ministry:** Scripture teaching brings spiritual transformation
- **Holy Separation:** God's people must maintain distinctiveness
- **Confession and Reform:** True repentance leads to practical changes
- **Preparation for Messiah:** Proper understanding prepares for Christ's coming

**Study Questions:**
1. What made Ezra's ministry so effective in bringing renewal?
2. Why was the issue of intermarriage so serious for the returned community?
3. How does faithful Bible teaching produce spiritual transformation?
