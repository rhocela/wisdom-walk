**God's Bigger Plan:** The rebuilt walls represent security and restored dignity for God's people. Nehemiah's leadership style of combining prayer with action provides a model for godly leadership. The physical restoration prepares for spiritual restoration through the coming Messiah.

**Connecting the Dots:** Nehemiah records the remarkable wall-building project and ongoing reforms. Psalm 127 emphasizes that without God's blessing, human efforts are futile. Ephesians speaks of Christ breaking down dividing walls. Paul encourages standing firm in the work.
