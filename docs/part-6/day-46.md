# Kingdom Divided: The Consequences of Disobedience

**Day:** 46

**When this Happened:** Shechem - The kingdom splits into Israel and Judah

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Rehoboam's harsh response to the people's request for lighter taxation leads to the kingdom's permanent division. Ten tribes follow Jeroboam to form the northern kingdom of Israel, while Judah and Benjamin remain loyal to David's house.
 - [1 Kings 12:1–14:31 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+12%3A1-14%3A31) (History)
 - [2 Chronicles 10:1–12:16 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+10%3A1-12%3A16) (History)
 - [Hosea 8:4-7 (Prophecy)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+8%3A4-7) (Prophecy)
 - [Romans 1:28-32 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A28-32) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** The division fulfills God's judgment on Solomon's idolatry while preserving the messianic line through Judah. It demonstrates that human rebellion cannot ultimately thwart God's purposes, though it brings painful consequences.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Kings and Chronicles record the division and immediate aftermath. Hosea speaks of the consequences of rejecting God's appointed leadership. Romans describes God giving people over to the consequences of their choices.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Judgment:** God's patience has limits; persistent sin brings consequences
- **Protective Preservation:** God preserves the messianic line through Judah
- **Human Responsibility:** Foolish leadership creates lasting damage
- **Sovereignty and Freedom:** God works through human choices to accomplish His will

**Study Questions:**
1. What role did poor leadership play in the kingdom's division?
2. How does God preserve His redemptive purposes despite human failure?
3. What does this teach about the long-term consequences of spiritual compromise?
