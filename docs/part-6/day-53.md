# Manasseh's Evil: The Depths of Apostasy

**Day:** 53

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - Manasseh's long reign of wickedness

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Manasseh, Hezekiah's son, reigns for 55 years and leads Judah into the worst apostasy in its history. He rebuilds the idols his father destroyed, practices child sacrifice, and fills Jerusalem with innocent blood. Though he later repents, the damage is irreversible.
 - [2 Kings 21:1-18 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+21%3A1-18)
 - [2 Chronicles 33:1-20 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+33%3A1-20)
 - [Jeremiah 15:1-4 (Prophecy)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+15%3A1-4)
 - [2 Peter 3:8-9 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A8-9)

**God's Bigger Plan:** Manasseh's reign shows how quickly spiritual gains can be lost and demonstrates that even the worst sinner can find forgiveness through repentance. However, it also teaches that forgiveness doesn't always eliminate temporal consequences of sin.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Kings emphasizes Manasseh's wickedness and its consequences. Chronicles adds his later repentance and partial reform. Jeremiah declares that because of Manasseh's sins, judgment on Judah is inevitable. Peter explains God's patience, not wanting any to perish.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Spiritual Regression:** Progress can be quickly undone by poor leadership
- **Consequences Remain:** Repentance brings forgiveness but not always restoration
- **Divine Patience:** God endures long rebellion before final judgment
- **Personal vs. National:** Individual salvation possible even in apostate societies

**Study Questions:**
1. How could Hezekiah's godly son become so wicked?
2. What does Manasseh's late repentance teach about God's mercy?
3. How do the sins of leaders affect entire generations?
