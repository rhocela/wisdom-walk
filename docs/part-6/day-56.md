# Jerusalem Falls: The End of the Kingdom

**Day:** 56

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - Babylonian siege and destruction

**Readings:**
- 2 Kings 24:1–25:30 (History)
- Jeremiah 39:1–52:34 (Prophecy)
- Ezekiel 1:1–24:27 (Prophecy)
- Luke 19:41-44 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** After multiple rebellions against Babylon, Jerusalem finally falls in 586 BC. The temple is destroyed, the city burned, and the population deported to Babylon. The Davidic kingdom appears to end, fulfilling the prophetic warnings of judgment.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Jerusalem's destruction demonstrates that God's judgment is certain and that not even His holy city is exempt from consequences of sin. Yet even in judgment, God preserves a remnant and maintains His covenant promises for future restoration.

**Connecting the Dots:** The historical and prophetic accounts detail the siege, destruction, and exile. Ezekiel prophesies among the early exiles, seeing visions of God's glory departing the temple. Jesus weeps over Jerusalem, predicting another future destruction.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Justice:** God's holiness demands judgment of persistent sin
- **Temple Destroyed:** Human religious institutions cannot guarantee protection
- **Exile as Discipline:** Removal from the land serves corrective purposes
- **Covenant Continuity:** God's promises survive apparent failure

**Study Questions:**
1. Why did God allow His holy city and temple to be destroyed?
2. How does the exile serve God's redemptive purposes?
3. What hope remained for God's people in this darkest hour?
