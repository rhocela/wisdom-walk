**Historical Context:** God raises up Cyrus the Persian to conquer Babylon and decree the return of Jewish exiles to their homeland. This demonstrates God's control over world empires and His faithfulness to restore His people according to His promised timeline. Obadiah prophesies against Edom for their treachery against Judah during the Babylonian invasion, showing that God remembers and judges all wrongs against His people.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Cyrus serves as God's "anointed one" (messiah) to accomplish redemption for Israel, prefiguring how God uses various instruments to accomplish His purposes. Obadiah demonstrates that God executes perfect justice against those who oppress His people. The return from exile prefigures the ultimate restoration through Christ.

**Connecting the Dots:** Daniel's visions reveal God's sovereignty over successive empires. Isaiah prophetically names Cyrus before he's born and describes his role. Obadiah shows God's justice against Edom's pride and betrayal. Ezra records Cyrus's decree enabling the return. Paul teaches that all authority comes from God.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God controls the rise and fall of nations
- **Perfect Justice:** God remembers and judges all wrongs against His people
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:** Specific predictions come to pass exactly
- **Instrument of Grace:** God uses pagan rulers to bless His people
- **Pride Before Fall:** Arrogance leads to divine judgment
- **Restoration Promised:** God keeps His word about return from exile
