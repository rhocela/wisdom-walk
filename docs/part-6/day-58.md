# Persian Rise: God Moves the Nations

**Day:** 58

**When this Happened:** Persian Empire - Cyrus conquers Babylon

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** God raises up Cyrus the Persian to conquer Babylon and decree the return of Jewish exiles to their homeland. This demonstrates God's control over world empires and His faithfulness to restore His people according to His promised timeline.

 - [Isaiah 44:24–45:25 (Prophecy)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+44%3A24-45%3A25)
 - [Ezra 1:1-11 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+1%3A1-11)
 - [Romans 13:1-7 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A1-7)

**God's Bigger Plan:** Cyrus serves as God's "anointed one" (messiah) to accomplish redemption for Israel, prefiguring how God uses various instruments to accomplish His purposes. The return from exile prefigures the ultimate restoration through Christ.

**Connecting the Dots:** Daniel's visions reveal God's sovereignty over successive empires. Isaiah prophetically names Cyrus before he's born and describes his role. Ezra records Cyrus's decree enabling the return. Paul teaches that all authority comes from God.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Sovereignty:** God controls the rise and fall of nations
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:** Specific predictions come to pass exactly
- **Instrument of Grace:** God uses pagan rulers to bless His people
- **Restoration Promised:** God keeps His word about return from exile

**Study Questions:**
1. How does Cyrus's role demonstrate God's sovereignty over nations?
2. What does it mean that Cyrus is called God's "anointed one"?
3. How do you see God working through secular authorities today?
