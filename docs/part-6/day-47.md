# Northern Kingdom: Jeroboam's Golden Calves

**Day:** 47

**When this Happened:** Northern Israel - Establishing alternative worship

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Fearing his people will return to Jerusalem for worship, Jeroboam establishes alternative worship centers at Dan and Bethel with golden calves. This "sin of Jeroboam" becomes the pattern for all subsequent northern kings.
 - [1 Kings 12:25â€“13:34 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+12%3A25-13%3A34)
 - [2 Kings 17:7-23 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+17%3A7-23)
 - [Amos 4:4-5, 5:4-6 (Prophecy)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+4%3A4-5%2C+5%3A4-6)
 - [1 Corinthians 1:18-25 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+1%3A18-25)

**God's Bigger Plan:** Jeroboam's political religion demonstrates how human wisdom contradicts God's ways. His attempt to create convenient worship leads to spiritual disaster, showing that we cannot improve on God's design for approaching Him.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Kings shows Jeroboam's establishment of false worship. 2 Kings summarizes how this led to Israel's eventual exile. Amos condemns the false worship centers. Paul contrasts human wisdom with God's "foolish" ways that are actually wise.

****Theological Threads:****
- **False Worship:** Human convenience cannot replace God's prescribed ways
- **Political Religion:** Using faith for political purposes corrupts both
- **Progressive Apostasy:** Small compromises lead to complete departure from truth
- **Divine Patience:** God sends warnings before final judgment

**Study Questions:**
1. Why was Jeroboam's alternative worship system so spiritually dangerous?
2. How do political considerations sometimes corrupt religious practice today?
3. What does this teach about the importance of worshiping God His way?
