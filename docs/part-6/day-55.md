# Jeremiah's Call: Weeping Prophet of Judgment

**Day:** 55

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - Jeremiah's ministry during Judah's final days

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Called as a young man, Jeremiah prophesies for over 40 years during Judah's decline and fall. His message of inevitable judgment makes him unpopular, earning him persecution and imprisonment, yet he faithfully warns of coming destruction while promising future restoration.
 - [Jeremiah 1:1–25:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+1%3A1-25%3A38) (Prophecy)
 - [Lamentations 1:1–5:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations+1%3A1-5%3A22) (Poetry)
 - [Matthew 16:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A13-14) (Gospel)
 - [2 Corinthians 7:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+7%3A10) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** Jeremiah's ministry prefigures Christ's rejection by His own people and demonstrates the cost of faithful prophetic ministry. His prophecies of a new covenant point directly to the gospel and God's ultimate plan of redemption.

**Connecting the Dots:** Jeremiah's prophecies span Judah's final period and include promises of restoration. Lamentations expresses grief over Jerusalem's destruction. Jesus was identified with Jeremiah by some people. Paul distinguishes between godly grief that leads to repentance and worldly grief.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Prophetic Suffering:** Faithful messengers often face rejection and persecution
- **Divine Grief:** God sorrows over His people's rebellion and coming judgment
- **New Covenant Promise:** Hope for future restoration through God's grace
- **Godly Sorrow:** True repentance produces lasting change
