# Jeremiah's Call: Weeping Prophet of Judgment

**Day:** 55

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - Jeremiah's ministry during Judah's final days

**Readings:**
 - [Jeremiah 1:1–25:38](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JER.1.ESV) (Prophecy)
 - [Lamentations 1:1–5:22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/LAM.1.ESV) (Poetry)
 - [Habakkuk 1:1–3:19](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/HAB.1.ESV) (Prophecy)
 - [Matthew 16:13-14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.16.13-14.ESV) (Gospel)
 - [2 Corinthians 7:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CO.7.10.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Called as a young man, Jeremiah prophesies for over 40 years during Judah's decline and fall. His message of inevitable judgment makes him unpopular, earning him persecution and imprisonment, yet he faithfully warns of coming destruction while promising future restoration. Habakkuk wrestles with similar themes, questioning how a holy God can use evil Babylon to judge His people, ultimately arriving at faith that transcends circumstances.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Jeremiah's ministry prefigures Christ's rejection by His own people and demonstrates the cost of faithful prophetic ministry. Habakkuk shows that faith can triumph over doubt and circumstances. Both prophets point toward God's ultimate plan of redemption through a new covenant, teaching that "the righteous shall live by faith."

**Connecting the Dots:** Jeremiah's prophecies span Judah's final period and include promises of restoration. Lamentations expresses grief over Jerusalem's destruction. Habakkuk wrestles with theodicy and concludes with faith-filled praise. Jesus was identified with Jeremiah by some people. Paul distinguishes between godly grief that leads to repentance and worldly grief.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Prophetic Suffering:** Faithful messengers often face rejection and persecution
- **Divine Grief:** God sorrows over His people's rebellion and coming judgment
- **Wrestling with God:** Honest questions can lead to deeper faith
- **Faith Above Circumstances:** Trust in God transcends difficult situations
- **New Covenant Promise:** Hope for future restoration through God's grace
- **Living by Faith:** Righteousness comes through faith, not works

**Study Questions:**
1. What sustained Jeremiah through decades of rejection and persecution?
2. How does Habakkuk's questioning lead to greater faith?
3. How do these prophets' promises of a new covenant point to Christ?
4. What is the difference between godly sorrow and worldly sorrow?
5. How can we maintain faith when circumstances seem to contradict God's character?
