# Revelation: Christ Unveiled

**Day:** 94

**When this Happened:** Patmos - John's vision of Jesus and the churches

**Readings:**
- [Revelation 1:1â€“3:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+1%3A1-3%3A22) (Apocalypse)
- [Daniel 7:9-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7%3A9-14) (Prophecy)

- [John 14:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A1-7) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** John, exiled on Patmos, receives a vision of the glorified Christ and messages for seven churches. The vision reveals Jesus' majesty, authority, and care for His people in times of trial.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Christ is revealed as the Alpha and Omega, the One who walks among His churches and holds history in His hands. The letters call believers to faithfulness, repentance, and hope.

**Connecting the Dots:** Revelation unveils Christ's glory. Daniel prophesies the Son of Man's authority. Exodus shows God's holy presence. John records Jesus' promise of eternal life.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Majesty of Christ:** Jesus is Lord of history and the church
- **Faithfulness:** The call to endure and overcome
- **Divine Presence:** God with His people in every age
- **Hope in Trial:** Assurance of Christ's victory

**Study Questions:**
