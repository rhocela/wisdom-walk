# Revelation: The Seals and Trumpets

**Day:** 96

**When this Happened:** Heaven and earth - visions of judgment and intercession

**Readings:**
- Revelation 6:1–8:13 (Apocalypse)
- Joel 2:1-11 (Prophecy)
- Exodus 7:14–12:30 (Narrative)
- Luke 21:25-28 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** John sees the Lamb open seven seals, unleashing judgments on the earth. The prayers of the saints rise before God, and seven trumpets announce further judgments, echoing the plagues of Egypt and prophetic warnings.

**God's Bigger Plan:** God's judgments are both just and merciful, calling humanity to repentance. The prayers of believers play a vital role in God's unfolding plan, and hope remains for those who trust in Him.

**Connecting the Dots:** Revelation details judgment and intercession. Joel warns of the day of the Lord. Exodus recounts plagues and deliverance. Luke points to signs of redemption.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Justice and Mercy:** God's judgments are righteous and redemptive
- **Power of Prayer:** Saints' prayers influence history
- **Call to Repentance:** Judgment invites turning to God
- **Hope Amid Trial:** Redemption is promised for the faithful

**Study Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of God's judgments?
2. How do the prayers of the saints matter?
3. What hope does Revelation offer in times of trial?
