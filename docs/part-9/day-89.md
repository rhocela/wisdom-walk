# Galatians: Freedom in Christ

**Day:** 89

**Chronological Setting:** Galatia - Paul's defense of the gospel of grace

**Readings:**

- [John 8:31-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A31-36) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** The Galatian believers were tempted to return to legalism. Paul passionately defends the gospel of grace, declaring that Christ has set believers free from the law's bondage and calls them to live by the Spirit.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Freedom in Christ fulfills God's promise of liberation and enables believers to live in the Spirit's power, bearing fruit and serving one another in love.

**Connecting the Dots:** Galatians proclaims freedom from the law. Exodus recounts liberation from Egypt. Isaiah foretells freedom for captives. John records Jesus' promise of true freedom.

****Theological Threads:****

- **Life in the Spirit:** The Spirit empowers holy living
- **Fruitfulness:** Freedom leads to spiritual fruit
- **Love as Fulfillment:** Love fulfills the law's intent
