# 1 Corinthians: Unity in Christ

**Day:** 87

**Chronological Setting:** Corinth - Paul's letter to a divided church

**Readings:**
- [1 Corinthians 1:10–3:23](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1CO.1.10-3.23.ESV) (Epistle)
- [Psalm 133:1-3](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.133.1-3.ESV) (Poetry)

- [John 17:20-23](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.17.20-23.ESV) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** The Corinthian church struggled with factions and pride. Paul urges believers to be united in Christ, reminding them that all are part of one body and that divisions undermine the gospel's witness.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Unity in the church reflects God's nature and fulfills Jesus' prayer for oneness among His followers. It enables the church to function effectively and display God's love to the world.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Corinthians addresses division and unity. Psalm 133 celebrates the blessing of unity. Numbers warns against rebellion. John records Jesus' prayer for unity among believers.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Unity in Diversity:** Many members, one body
- **Christ as Center:** Unity found in Christ alone
- **Witness to the World:** Unity displays God's love
- **Guarding Against Division:** Humility and love prevent strife

**Study Questions:**
1. Why is unity so important in the church?
2. How can believers guard against division?
3. How does unity reflect God's character?
