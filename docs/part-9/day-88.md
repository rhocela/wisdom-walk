# 2 Corinthians: Strength in Weakness

**Day:** 88

**When this Happened:** Corinth - Paul's encouragement to a suffering church

**Readings:**
- 2 Corinthians 12:1-10 (Epistle)
- Isaiah 40:28-31 (Prophecy)
- Judges 7:1-22 (Narrative)
- Matthew 5:3-12 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Paul shares his own struggles and "thorn in the flesh," teaching that God's grace is sufficient and His power is perfected in human weakness. The church is encouraged to rely on God's strength rather than their own.

**God's Bigger Plan:** God uses weakness to display His glory and to keep believers dependent on Him. This principle runs throughout Scripture, showing that true strength comes from God alone.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Corinthians highlights strength in weakness. Isaiah promises renewed strength. Judges shows God working through weakness. Matthew records Jesus' blessings for the humble and needy.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Grace Sufficiency:** God's grace meets every need
- **Power in Weakness:** Human frailty magnifies divine strength
- **Dependence on God:** Weakness keeps us reliant on Him
- **Glory Through Trials:** Suffering can reveal God's glory

**Study Questions:**
1. How does weakness become a strength in God's kingdom?
2. What does it mean to rely on God's grace?
3. How can suffering bring glory to God?
