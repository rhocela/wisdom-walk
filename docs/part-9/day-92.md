- [Philemon 1:1-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PHM.1.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Paul writes to affirm Christ's supremacy over all creation, emphasizing His role as Creator, Sustainer, and Redeemer. The church is called to hold fast to Christ and reject false teachings. Alongside this, Paul's personal letter to Philemon demonstrates practical Christian love and forgiveness in action.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Christ's supremacy fulfills God's plan to reconcile all things to Himself. Believers are rooted in Christ, who is the image of the invisible God and the head of the church.

**Connecting the Dots:** Colossians proclaims Christ's supremacy over all creation. Philemon shows this supremacy applied practically in relationships - how Christian love transforms social bonds. Psalm 8 celebrates humanity's place in creation. Genesis describes humanity's creation in God's image. John reveals Christ as the eternal Word.
