# Ephesians: One New Humanity

**Day:** 90

**When this Happened:** Ephesus - Paul's letter on church unity and identity

**Readings:**
- Ephesians 2:11-22 (Epistle)
- Genesis 12:1-3 (Narrative)
- Isaiah 2:1-4 (Prophecy)
- John 17:20-23 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Paul explains that Christ has broken down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile, creating one new humanity. The church is now a unified body, reconciled to God and each other through the cross.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The unity of believers fulfills God's promise to bless all nations and reveals His plan to unite all things in Christ. The church becomes a living temple, a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.

**Connecting the Dots:** Ephesians describes the new humanity. Genesis introduces God's promise to Abraham. Isaiah envisions global peace. John records Jesus' prayer for unity.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Unity in Christ:** All believers are one in Him
