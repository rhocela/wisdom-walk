# Ephesians: One New Humanity

**Day:** 90

**Chronological Setting:** Ephesus - Paul's letter on church unity and identity

**Readings:**
- [Ephesians 2:11-22](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EPH.2.11-22.ESV) (Epistle)
- [Genesis 12:1-3](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.12.1-3.ESV) (Narrative)
- [Isaiah 2:1-4](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.2.1-4.ESV) (Prophecy)
- [John 17:20-23](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.17.20-23.ESV) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Paul explains that Christ has broken down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile, creating one new humanity. The church is now a unified body, reconciled to God and each other through the cross.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The unity of believers fulfills God's promise to bless all nations and reveals His plan to unite all things in Christ. The church becomes a living temple, a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.

**Connecting the Dots:** Ephesians describes the new humanity. Genesis introduces God's promise to Abraham. Isaiah envisions global peace. John records Jesus' prayer for unity.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Unity in Christ:** All believers are one in Him
- **Reconciliation:** The cross brings peace with God and others
- **Global Blessing:** God's plan includes all nations
- **Living Temple:** The church as God's dwelling place

**Study Questions:**
1. How does Christ create one new humanity?
2. What does reconciliation mean for relationships?
3. How does the church fulfill God's promise to Abraham?
