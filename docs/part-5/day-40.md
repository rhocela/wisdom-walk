# David's Kingdom: United Under God's King

**Day:** 40

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - David establishes his kingdom and capital

**Readings:**
- 2 Samuel 1:1–10:19 (History)
- 1 Chronicles 11:1–19:19 (History)
- Psalm 2, 110 (Poetry)
- Ephesians 1:20-23 (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** David becomes king over all Israel, conquers Jerusalem to make it his capital, brings the ark there, and receives God's covenant promise of an eternal dynasty. His military victories establish Israel as a regional power.

**God's Bigger Plan:** David's kingdom represents the ideal of God's rule on earth and prefigures Christ's eternal kingdom. The establishment of Jerusalem as the holy city and the promise of an eternal dynasty point forward to the New Jerusalem and Christ's eternal reign.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Samuel and Chronicles detail David's rise to power and military victories. Psalm 2 celebrates God's anointed king and His kingdom. Psalm 110 speaks of the priest-king after Melchizedek's order. Ephesians describes Christ's exaltation above all rule and authority.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Kingship:** Human kingship as reflection of God's rule
- **Jerusalem Established:** The holy city as center of worship
- **Covenant Dynasty:** Promise of eternal throne through David's line
- **Victory Over Enemies:** God's king triumphs over all opposition

**Study Questions:**
1. How does David's kingdom point to Christ's eternal kingdom?
2. What made Jerusalem significant as David's capital choice?
3. How does God's covenant with David give hope for the future?
