# David's Flight: Tested in the Wilderness

**Day:** 39

**When this Happened:** Wilderness of Judea - David fleeing from Saul's jealousy

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Saul's jealousy leads to years of David fleeing for his life. During this period, David gathers a band of followers and twice has opportunity to kill Saul but refuses to harm "the Lord's anointed."
 - [1 Samuel 18:1â€“31:13 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+18%3A1-31%3A13)
 - [Psalm 23, 34, 57, 142 (Poetry)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23%2C+34%2C+57%2C+142)
 - [Hebrews 11:32-40 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A32-40)
 - [1 Peter 2:19-25 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A19-25)

**God's Bigger Plan:** David's refusal to take revenge and his patient waiting for God's timing prefigure Christ's patient endurance of suffering. His wilderness experience shapes him into the leader God intends him to be.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Samuel narrates David's flight, his restraint in sparing Saul, and the eventual deaths of Saul and Jonathan. The Psalms express David's trust in God during persecution. Hebrews commends the faith of those who suffered while awaiting God's promises. Peter teaches about suffering unjustly while following Christ's example.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Patient Endurance:** Waiting for God's timing rather than forcing circumstances
- **Respect for Authority:** Honoring God-appointed leadership even when flawed
- **Wilderness Preparation:** Testing and refining through difficult circumstances
- **Faith in Suffering:** Trusting God when circumstances seem hopeless

**Study Questions:**
1. Why did David refuse to kill Saul when he had the opportunity?
2. How do the Psalms from this period encourage you in difficult times?
3. What does David's wilderness experience teach about God's preparation process?
