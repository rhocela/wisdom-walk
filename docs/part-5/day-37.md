# Saul's Failure: The Rejected King

**Day:** 37

**Chronological Setting:** Early monarchy - Saul's reign and rejection

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Saul, chosen as Israel's first king, begins well but gradually reveals character flaws. His disobedience to God's clear commands, particularly regarding the Amalekites, results in God's rejection of him as king.
 - [1 Samuel 9:1–15:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+9%3A1-15%3A35) (History)
 - [Acts 13:21-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+13%3A21-22) (History)
 - [1 Timothy 1:12-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A12-16) (Epistle)
 - [Romans 11:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A29) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** Saul's failure demonstrates that external qualifications don't guarantee success in God's service. His rejection shows that God's calling requires ongoing obedience and that God's gifts and calling, while irrevocable, can be forfeited through persistent disobedience.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Samuel details Saul's anointing, early successes, and ultimate rejection. Acts contrasts Saul with David as a man after God's heart. Paul uses his own experience to show God's mercy to the disobedient. Romans speaks of God's irrevocable gifts and calling.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Character Over Appearance:** God looks at the heart, not outward appearance
- **Partial Obedience as Disobedience:** Half-hearted compliance equals rebellion
- **Divine Patience:** God gives multiple opportunities for repentance
- **Consequences of Rebellion:** Persistent disobedience brings judgment

**Study Questions:**
1. What character flaws led to Saul's downfall?
2. How does partial obedience manifest in your life?
3. What does Saul's story teach about the importance of complete surrender to God?
