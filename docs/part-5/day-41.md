# David's Sin: The Consequences of Moral Failure

**Day:** 41

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - David's adultery with Bathsheba and its aftermath

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** At the height of his power, David commits adultery with Bathsheba and arranges her husband Uriah's death in battle. Nathan the prophet confronts David, leading to repentance but also severe consequences for his family.
 - [2 Samuel 11:1â€“12:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+11%3A1-12%3A31) (History)
 - [Psalm 32, 51](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+32%2C+51) (Poetry)
 - [Romans 4:6-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A6-8) (Epistle)
 - [1 John 1:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A8-10) (Epistle)

**God's Bigger Plan:** David's fall and restoration demonstrate that even God's chosen leaders are fallible and that forgiveness is available for any sin through genuine repentance. His psalms of confession become models for approaching God after moral failure.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Samuel narrates the sin, confrontation, and consequences. Psalms 32 and 51 express David's repentance and experience of forgiveness. Romans quotes David on the blessedness of forgiveness. John teaches about confession and cleansing from sin.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Universal Sinfulness:** Even the greatest saints are capable of grave sin
- **Prophetic Confrontation:** God sends messengers to call leaders to account
- **Genuine Repentance:** True sorrow leads to forgiveness and restoration
- **Forgiveness Available:** No sin too great for God's mercy

3. What does David's restoration teach about God's forgiveness?
