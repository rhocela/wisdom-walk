# David's Sin: The Consequences of Moral Failure

**Day:** 41

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem - David's adultery with Bathsheba and its aftermath

**Readings:**
 - [2 Samuel 11:1–12:31](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2SA.11.1-12.31.ESV) (History)
 - [Psalm 32, 51](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.32,51.ESV) (Poetry)
 - [Romans 4:6-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.4.6-8.ESV) (Epistle)
 - [1 John 1:8-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1JN.1.8-10.ESV) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** At the height of his power, David commits adultery with Bathsheba and arranges her husband Uriah's death in battle. Nathan the prophet confronts David, leading to repentance but also severe consequences for his family.

**God's Bigger Plan:** David's fall and restoration demonstrate that even God's chosen leaders are fallible and that forgiveness is available for any sin through genuine repentance. His psalms of confession become models for approaching God after moral failure.

**Connecting the Dots:** 2 Samuel narrates the sin, confrontation, and consequences. Psalms 32 and 51 express David's repentance and experience of forgiveness. Romans quotes David on the blessedness of forgiveness. John teaches about confession and cleansing from sin.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Universal Sinfulness:** Even the greatest saints are capable of grave sin
- **Prophetic Confrontation:** God sends messengers to call leaders to account
- **Genuine Repentance:** True sorrow leads to forgiveness and restoration
- **Forgiveness Available:** No sin too great for God's mercy

**Study Questions:**
1. What factors led to David's moral compromise?
2. How do David's psalms of repentance guide your response to sin?
3. What does David's restoration teach about God's forgiveness?
