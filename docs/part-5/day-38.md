# David Anointed: The Man After God's Heart

**Day:** 38

**Chronological Setting:** Bethlehem - God chooses David while Saul still reigns

**Readings:**
 - [1 Samuel 16:1–17:58](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1SA.16.1-17.58.ESV) (History)
 - [Acts 13:22-23](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ACT.13.22-23.ESV) (History)
 - [Psalm 78:70-72](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.78.70-72.ESV) (Poetry)
 - [1 Chronicles 17:7-14](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1CH.17.7-14.ESV) (History)

**Historical Context:** While Saul still occupies the throne, God directs Samuel to anoint young David as the next king. David's victory over Goliath demonstrates that God's power works through faith, not human strength or conventional weapons.

**God's Bigger Plan:** David represents God's choice of the humble and faithful rather than the impressive and proud. His lineage becomes the royal line through which Christ will come, making him a crucial figure in the messianic promise.

**Connecting the Dots:** 1 Samuel shows David's anointing and early demonstration of faith in facing Goliath. Acts identifies David as a man after God's heart and connects him to Jesus. Psalm 78 celebrates God's choice of David as shepherd-king. Chronicles records God's covenant promise to establish David's house forever.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Choice:** God chooses based on heart condition, not outward appearance
- **Faith Over Fear:** Trust in God overcomes seemingly impossible obstacles
- **Shepherd-King Model:** Leadership that cares for and protects people
- **Messianic Line:** David's throne established forever through Christ

**Study Questions:**
1. What made David "a man after God's heart"?
2. How does David's victory over Goliath encourage your faith?
3. What does David's shepherd background teach about godly leadership?
