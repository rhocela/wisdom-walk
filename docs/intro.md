# The Bible Bridge

<div className="subtitle">So, you want to read the whole Bible. Where do you start?</div>

**Welcome to The Bible Bridge!** I've always wanted to read the whole Bible in a way that would help me understand the intricate connections between passages throughout Scripture. Rather than reading isolated verses, I wanted to *see* the full picture of the passages I read, and know what other parts of Scriptures connect with what I'm reading.

This project is my attempt to achieve that experience‚Äîby bridging related passages throughout Scripture.

With this reading plan, you will not only read the Bible chronologically‚Äîyou will also discover how passages connect thematically and theologically. This means that as you read through the **historical sequence** of events, you will also be guided to **related passages** to deepen your understanding of what you're reading.

## How to Use this Study

This plan organizes the Bible into **100 thematic studies** (labeled as days). These themes are grouped into 10 larger parts that trace the overall story of redemption from Genesis to Revelation.

Each theme (day) has its own page with following details:

- **When this happened:** Shows you where these events fit in Bible history.
- **Historical context:** Provides the background and circumstances surrounding the biblical events.
- **Readings:** Lists the specific Bible passages to read, along with their  [literary genres](#literary-genres-explained).
- **Redemptive focus:** Shows how each theme fits into God's overall plan of salvation.
- **Connecting the dots:** Explains how the different Bible passages work together to reveal the same truth.
- **Theological Threads:** Identifies key truths about God that emerge from these passages.


 :::tip Read at your own pace üôÇ
While this plan is designed to be a 100-day journey, read it at your own pace. Quality over speed is the goal. Take your time, meditate on the passages and their connections, ask the Holy Spirit for insights, and enjoy the journey!
:::

 I hope this study deepens your understanding of **God**'s heart, the person of the **Holy Spirit**, and our salvation through **Jesus Christ**.


## Literary Genres Explained
