# The Bible Bridge

<div className="subtitle">So, you want to read the whole Bible. Where do you start?</div>

**Welcome to The Bible Bridge!** 

I've always wanted to read the whole Bible chronologically AND with meaning. Rather than reading isolated verses, I longed to *see* the intricate connections between passages throughout Scripture. This project is the result of that desire.

The Bible Bridge is a reading plan that not only walks you through the **historical sequence** of events in the Bible–it also connects **related passages** that provide context, meaning, and insights to help you interpret and understand what you're reading.

## How to Use this Study

This plan organizes the Bible into **100 thematic studies** (labeled as days). These themes are grouped into 10 larger parts that trace the overall story of redemption from Genesis to Revelation.

Each theme (day) has its own page with the following details:

- **When this happened:** Where these events fit in Bible history.
- **Historical context:** The background and circumstances surrounding the biblical events.
- **Readings:** Specific Bible passages to read, along with their  [literary genres](#literary-genres-explained).
- **Redemptive focus:** How each theme fits into God's overall plan of salvation.
- **Connecting the dots:** How the different Bible passages work together to reveal the same truth.
- **Theological Threads:** Key truths about God that emerge from these passages.


 :::tip Read at your own pace
While this plan is designed to be a 100-day journey, read it at your own pace. Quality over speed is the goal. Take your time, meditate on the passages and their connections, ask the Holy Spirit for insights, and enjoy the journey!

## Literary Genres Explained

Each Bible reading includes its literary genre to help you understand how to read it. These are the genres and how to read them:

- **Narrative:** Stories that tell what happened. Read them as historical accounts with characters, settings, and plots.
- **Poetry:** Songs and wisdom literature. Read them for their artistic expression and emotional depth.
- **Gospel:** Accounts of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Read them to understand the person and work of Christ.
- **Epistle:** Letters addressing early Christian communities. Read them for theological teaching and practical application.
- **Prophecy:** Messages from God delivered through prophets. Read them with an awareness of their historical context and future fulfillment.
- **Apocalyptic:** Revelations about the end times and God's ultimate victory. Read them for their symbolic language and hope-filled message.
- **Wisdom:** Teachings on how to live a godly life. Read them for practical guidance and moral insight.

## Bible Translation to Use

I use the English Standard Version **(ESV)** for this study, as it is known for its balance between word-for-word accuracy and readability. If I want to gain more clarity on certain passages, I typically refer to the Amplified Bible **(AMP)** for a more expansive translation, or the New Living Translation **(NLT)** for a thought-for-thought approach.

## Let's Go!

All 1,189 chapters are distributed across 100 chronologically-arranged themes, ensuring every verse from Genesis 1:1 to Revelation 22:21 is included exactly once while maintaining both historical sequence and thematic unity.

I hope this study deepens your understanding of **God**'s heart, the person of the **Holy Spirit**, and our salvation through **Jesus Christ**.
