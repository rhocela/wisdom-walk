# The Bible Study Project

<div className="subtitle">Reading the Whole Bible with Purpose</div>

I've always wanted to read the Bible from cover to cover in a way that would help me understand the intricate tapestry of connections between passages throughout Scriptureâ€”this study is my attempt to create that experience.

I hope you enjoy this journey and that it deepens your understanding of God's heart, the person of the Holy Spirit, and the love of Jesus Christ.

## How to use this study

Parts â†’ Themes â†’ Passages

This Bible reading plan is divided into 10 **parts** that cover major sections of the biblical narrative. Each part contains themes labeled as **days**, and each day includes 4-5 related Bible passages that illustrate the theme.

Each page has a theme and contains the following sections:

- **When this Happened:** Places each theme in its proper time period within the biblical story, helping you see how events unfold chronologically.
- **Historical Context:** Provides the background and circumstances surrounding the biblical events, helping you understand what was happening at that time.
- **God's Bigger Plan:** Shows how each theme fits into God's overall plan of salvation, connecting creation to redemption through Christ.
- **Why These Passages Connect:** Explains how the different Bible passages work together to reveal the same truth from multiple perspectives.
- ****Theological Threads:**** Highlights the main theological themes (doctrinal concepts) that emerge from the study, showing what we learn about God and His ways.


:::tip Read at your own pace ðŸ™‚
Go at your own pace and use the **Day #s** as a way to track your progress, rather than a rigid schedule. Quality over speed is the goal. Take your time, meditate on the passages, ask the Holy Spirit for insights, and enjoy the journey!
