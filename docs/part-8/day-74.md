**Historical Context:** During the Passover meal, Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper, washes the disciples' feet, and delivers His farewell discourse. He prepares them for His departure while establishing memorials and promises that will sustain them through the coming crisis.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The Last Supper transforms the Passover from a commemoration of Israel's deliverance from Egypt into a celebration of humanity's deliverance from sin through Christ's sacrifice. Jesus establishes the new covenant promised through Jeremiah.

**Connecting the Dots:** All Gospels record the Last Supper's significance. John provides the most detailed account including the farewell discourse and high priestly prayer. Paul explains the ongoing significance of communion for the church.

****Theological Threads:****
- **New Covenant:** Jesus' blood establishes the promised new relationship with God
- **Sacrificial Love:** Footwashing demonstrates servant leadership
- **Communion Memorial:** Regular remembrance of Christ's sacrifice
- **Departure Preparation:** Jesus prepares disciples for His absence

**Study Questions:**
1. How does the Last Supper transform the meaning of Passover?
2. What does Jesus teach through washing the disciples' feet?
3. How do Jesus' farewell promises sustain believers today?
