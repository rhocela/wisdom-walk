# Transfiguration Glory: Heaven Breaks Through

**Day:** 72

**When this Happened:** Mount of Transfiguration - Jesus revealed in glory

**Readings:**
- [Matthew 17:1–18:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+17%3A1-18%3A35) (Gospel)
- [Mark 9:1–10:52](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+9%3A1-10%3A52) (Gospel)
- [Luke 9:1–18:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A1-18%3A43) (Gospel)
- [2 Peter 1:16-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A16-21) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up a mountain where He is transfigured before them, appearing in heavenly glory and speaking with Moses and Elijah. The presence of Moses and Elijah shows that Jesus fulfills both the Law and the Prophets, while God's command to "listen to him" establishes Jesus' supreme authority.

**Connecting the Dots:** All three Synoptic Gospels record the transfiguration as a pivotal moment. The surrounding passages deal with discipleship cost and requirements. Peter's letter confirms the historical reality of what the disciples witnessed.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Divine Glory:** Jesus' true nature briefly revealed
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:** Moses and Elijah's presence confirms Jesus fulfills Scripture
- **Divine Testimony:** God's voice again confirms Jesus' identity
- **Discipleship Cost:** Following Jesus requires sacrifice and commitment

**Study Questions:**
1. What does the transfiguration reveal about Jesus' true identity?
2. Why do Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus?
3. How should the transfiguration affect our understanding of who Jesus is?
