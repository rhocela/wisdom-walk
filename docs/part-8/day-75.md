# Gethsemane's Agony: The Cup of Wrath

**Day:** 75

**When this Happened:** Garden of Gethsemane - Jesus' final prayer before arrest

**Readings:**
- [Matthew 26:36-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A36-56) (Gospel)
- [Mark 14:32-52](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+14%3A32-52) (Gospel)
- [Luke 22:39-53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A39-53) (Gospel)

- [Hebrews 5:7-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+5%3A7-10) (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** In Gethsemane, Jesus experiences intense anguish as He contemplates drinking the cup of God's wrath for sin. His willing submission to arrest shows that His death is voluntary sacrifice, not tragic accident.

**Connecting the Dots:** All Gospels record Gethsemane's significance for understanding Jesus' sacrifice. Hebrews explains how Jesus learned obedience through suffering and became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Voluntary Sacrifice:** Jesus chooses obedience despite personal cost
- **Cup of Wrath:** Jesus bears the punishment that sin deserves
- **Perfect Obedience:** Where Adam failed, Jesus succeeds completely
- **Priestly Ministry:** Jesus as both priest and offering

**Study Questions:**
1. What was in the "cup" that Jesus dreaded drinking?
2. How does Jesus' prayer demonstrate perfect submission to God's will?
3. What does Jesus' anguish reveal about the cost of our salvation?
