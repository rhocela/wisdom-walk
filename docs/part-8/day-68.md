# Temptation Victory: The New Adam Succeeds

**Day:** 68

**When this Happened:** Judean wilderness - Jesus' temptation by Satan

**Readings:**
- Matthew 4:1-11 (Gospel)
- Mark 1:12-13 (Gospel)
- Luke 4:1-13 (Gospel)
- Romans 5:12-21 (Epistle)
- Hebrews 4:14-16 (Epistle)

**Historical Context:** Immediately after His baptism, Jesus is led by the Spirit into the wilderness where He fasts for forty days and faces temptation by Satan. Unlike Adam and Israel, Jesus successfully resists every temptation, qualifying Him as the sinless Savior.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Jesus' victory over temptation reverses Adam's failure and demonstrates His qualification as the perfect sacrifice. His success where Israel failed shows Him as the true Israel, and His sinlessness enables Him to be both perfect priest and spotless offering.

**Connecting the Dots:** Matthew, Mark, and Luke all record the temptation, emphasizing its importance. Romans contrasts Adam's failure with Christ's success. Hebrews explains how Jesus' temptation without sin qualifies Him as our sympathetic high priest.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Second Adam:** Jesus succeeds where the first Adam failed
- **Perfect Obedience:** Sinless life qualifies Jesus as perfect sacrifice
- **Sympathetic Priest:** Jesus understands temptation without succumbing
- **Victory Over Satan:** Jesus defeats the enemy who conquered humanity

**Study Questions:**
1. How do Jesus' temptations parallel those faced by Adam and Israel?
2. What does Jesus' victory teach about overcoming temptation?
3. How does Jesus' sinlessness qualify Him to be our Savior and High Priest?
