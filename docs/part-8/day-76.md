# The Cross: Atonement Accomplished

**Day:** 76

**When this Happened:** Golgotha - Jesus' crucifixion and death

**Readings:**
- Matthew 27:1-56 (Gospel)

- Luke 23:1-49 (Gospel)
- John 18:28â€“19:37 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** After trials before Jewish and Roman authorities, Jesus is crucified between two criminals. His death occurs with supernatural signs including darkness over the land and the temple veil being torn, demonstrating the cosmic significance of His sacrifice.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The cross represents the central event of human history where God's justice and mercy meet. Jesus bears the penalty for sin that justice demands while providing the forgiveness that mercy desires, accomplishing redemption for all who believe.

**Connecting the Dots:** All four Gospels provide detailed crucifixion accounts, each emphasizing different aspects. Paul explains that Christ became sin for us. Peter teaches that Jesus bore our sins in His body on the tree.
