# Paul in Europe: Gospel Goes West

**Day:** 83

**When this Happened:** Macedonia and Greece - Paul's European ministry

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Directed by the Spirit and a vision of a Macedonian man, Paul crosses into Europe. He establishes churches in Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, and Corinth, encountering diverse cultures and varied responses to the gospel.
 - [Acts 16:6â€“18:22 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A6-18%3A22)
 - [Philippians 4:10-20 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A10-20)
 - [Isaiah 60:1-3 (Prophecy)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+60%3A1-3)
 - [Luke 2:29-32 (Gospel)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+2%3A29-32)

**God's Bigger Plan:** The gospel's entry into Europe represents a crucial expansion that will eventually reach the ends of the earth. This westward movement begins the process that will see Christianity become a truly global faith.

**Connecting the Dots:** Acts chronicles Paul's European journeys. Philippians reflects the fruit of ministry in Philippi. Isaiah prophesied light coming to the nations. Luke records Simeon's prophecy about Jesus as a light for the Gentiles.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Spirit's Guidance:** Divine direction in missionary strategy
- **Cultural Contextualization:** Adapting the message to different audiences
- **Church Planting:** Establishing sustainable Christian communities
- **Global Vision:** The gospel for every continent and culture

**Study Questions:**
1. How does Paul adapt his message to different cultural contexts?
2. What role does the Holy Spirit play in missionary guidance?
3. How do the European churches contribute to Paul's ongoing ministry?
