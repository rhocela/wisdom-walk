**Day:** 73

**When this Happened:** On the road to Jerusalem - Jesus' final journey

**Readings:**
- [Matthew 19:1–23:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A1-23%3A39) (Gospel)
- [Mark 11:1–12:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A1-12%3A44) (Gospel)

- [John 11:1–12:50](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A1-12%3A50) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Jesus makes His final journey to Jerusalem, teaching extensively about the kingdom, confronting religious leaders, and preparing His disciples for what's coming. His teachings during this period focus on the cost of discipleship and the judgment coming on those who reject Him, while His entry as king fulfills prophecy.

**Connecting the Dots:** All Gospels emphasize this final journey and its significance. Matthew records extensive teaching about the kingdom and judgment. Mark shows Jesus' authority challenged in the temple. Luke includes unique parables about grace and judgment. John adds the raising of Lazarus and its consequences.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Willing Sacrifice:** Jesus knowingly goes to His death
- **Messianic Fulfillment:** Entry as king fulfills specific prophecies
- **Final Warning:** Last opportunity for repentance before judgment
- **Life and Death Power:** Raising Lazarus demonstrates victory over death

**Study Questions:**
1. Why does Jesus resolutely set His face toward Jerusalem?
2. How does the triumphal entry fulfill Old Testament prophecy?
3. What does the raising of Lazarus reveal about Jesus' power and mission?
