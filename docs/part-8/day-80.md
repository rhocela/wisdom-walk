# Peter and Cornelius: Opening the Door

**Day:** 80

**When this Happened:** Caesarea - The gospel reaches the Gentiles

**Readings:**
- Acts 10:1â€“11:18 (History)
- Ephesians 2:11-22 (Epistle)
- Isaiah 56:6-8 (Prophecy)
- John 10:16 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Through a vision, God prepares Peter to visit Cornelius, a God-fearing Roman centurion. When Peter preaches to Cornelius's household, the Holy Spirit falls upon them, proving that salvation is available to Gentiles without first becoming Jewish proselytes.

**God's Bigger Plan:** This pivotal moment breaks down the barrier between Jew and Gentile, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed. It marks the beginning of the church's truly global mission.

**Connecting the Dots:** Acts narrates the breakthrough event. Ephesians explains the theological significance of Jew-Gentile unity. Isaiah prophesied God's house as a house of prayer for all nations. John records Jesus' vision of one flock from many flocks.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Universal Salvation:** The gospel is for every nation and people group
- **Breaking Barriers:** God removes ethnic and cultural divisions
- **Spirit's Witness:** The Holy Spirit confirms Gentile inclusion
- **Church Unity:** One body comprised of diverse backgrounds

**Study Questions:**
1. What barriers did God need to overcome in Peter's thinking?
2. How does Cornelius's conversion change the church's understanding of salvation?
3. What ethnic or cultural barriers might we need God to help us overcome?
