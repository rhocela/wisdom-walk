# Romans: The Gospel Explained

**Day:** 85

**When this Happened:** Rome - Paul's theological masterpiece

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Paul writes to the church in Rome, explaining the gospel's meaning, implications, and application. He addresses sin, salvation, justification, sanctification, and the future of Israel and the world, providing the most systematic presentation of Christian doctrine in the New Testament.

 - [Matthew 5:17-20 (Gospel)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-20)

**God's Bigger Plan:** Romans clarifies how the gospel fulfills God's promises to Abraham and the prophets, unites Jew and Gentile, and transforms lives. It lays the foundation for Christian faith and practice for all generations.

**Connecting the Dots:** Romans is the central epistle for understanding the gospel. Genesis shows Abraham's faith. Isaiah prophesies the suffering servant. Matthew records Jesus' teaching on the law's fulfillment.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Justification by Faith:** Salvation is a gift, not earned
- **Universal Need:** All have sinned, all need grace
- **Transformation:** The gospel changes lives and communities
- **Hope for the World:** God's plan includes all nations
