# Mounting Opposition: Conflict with Religious Leaders

**Day:** 71

**Chronological Setting:** Jerusalem and Galilee - Growing hostility toward Jesus

**Readings:**
- [Matthew 14:1–16:28](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.14.1-16.28.ESV) (Gospel)
- [Mark 7:1–8:38](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MRK.7.1-8.38.ESV) (Gospel)
- [Luke 10:1–11:54](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/LUK.10.1-11.54.ESV) (Gospel)
- [John 7:1–10:42](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.7.1-10.42.ESV) (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** As Jesus' popularity grows, opposition from religious leaders intensifies. Their opposition ironically confirms Jesus' identity as the one who threatens human religious systems with divine truth.

**Connecting the Dots:** All Gospels record increasing conflict between Jesus and religious authorities. Matthew shows how Jesus fulfills yet transcends Old Testament law. Mark emphasizes the growing tension. Luke records Jesus' warnings about religious hypocrisy. John presents extended debates about Jesus' identity.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Religious Blindness:** External righteousness can coexist with spiritual darkness
- **Divine Authority:** Jesus claims prerogatives that belong only to God
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:** Rejection by leaders predicted in Scripture
- **Heart vs. Externals:** God seeks internal transformation, not mere compliance

**Study Questions:**
1. Why did the religious leaders oppose Jesus so strongly?
2. How does Jesus expose the inadequacy of external righteousness?
3. What does their rejection teach about the human heart?
