# Ascension and Pentecost: The Spirit Comes

**Day:** 78

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - Jesus' ascension and the Spirit's arrival

**Readings:**
- Acts 1:1â€“2:47 (History)
- Ephesians 4:7-16 (Epistle)
- Joel 2:28-32 (Prophecy)
- John 14:16-26 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** After forty days of post-resurrection appearances, Jesus ascends to heaven and promises the Holy Spirit's coming. Ten days later, at Pentecost, the Spirit fills the disciples with power, enabling them to speak in various languages and boldly proclaim the gospel.

**God's Bigger Plan:** The ascension completes Jesus' earthly work and begins His heavenly intercession, while Pentecost inaugurates the church age. The Spirit's arrival fulfills Old Testament prophecy and empowers believers to be witnesses to the ends of the earth.

**Connecting the Dots:** Acts records the historical events of ascension and Pentecost. Ephesians explains the ascended Christ's gifts to the church. Joel's prophecy finds fulfillment at Pentecost. John records Jesus' promise of the Spirit's coming.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Mission Accomplished:** Jesus' earthly work completed, heavenly work begun
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:** Old Testament promises about the Spirit realized
- **Global Commission:** The gospel now goes to all nations and peoples
- **Divine Empowerment:** Believers receive supernatural ability for ministry

**Study Questions:**
1. What does Jesus' ascension accomplish for believers?
2. How does Pentecost fulfill Old Testament prophecy?
3. What role does the Holy Spirit play in the believer's life and mission?
