# Jerusalem Council: Faith Alone Confirmed

**Day:** 82

**When this Happened:** Jerusalem - The apostolic council

**Readings:**

**Historical Context:** Controversy arises over whether Gentile converts must be circumcised and follow the Mosaic law. The apostles and elders gather in Jerusalem to resolve this critical question, ultimately deciding that salvation is by grace through faith alone, not by works of the law.
 - [Acts 15:1-35 (History)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15%3A1-35)
 - [Galatians 2:1-21 (Epistle)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2%3A1-21)
 - [Amos 9:11-12 (Prophecy)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+9%3A11-12)
 - [John 1:17 (Gospel)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A17)

**God's Bigger Plan:** This council establishes the fundamental principle that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, not by works. It prevents Christianity from becoming merely a Jewish sect and ensures the gospel's universal accessibility.

**Connecting the Dots:** Acts records the council's proceedings and decision. Galatians provides Paul's perspective on the same events. Amos prophesied about the rebuilding of David's tent for the nations. John contrasts law (through Moses) with grace and truth (through Jesus).

****Theological Threads:****
- **Salvation by Grace:** Faith alone, not works plus faith
- **Gospel Clarity:** Clear distinction between law and grace
- **Unity in Diversity:** One gospel for both Jews and Gentiles
- **Apostolic Authority:** The apostles' role in settling doctrinal disputes

**Study Questions:**
1. Why was the Jerusalem Council's decision so crucial for the church?
2. How does this decision clarify the relationship between law and grace?
3. What does this teach about resolving theological controversies?
