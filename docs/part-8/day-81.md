# Paul's First Journey: Breaking New Ground

**Day:** 81

**When this Happened:** Asia Minor - Paul's first missionary journey

**Readings:**
- Acts 13:1â€“14:28 (History)
- 1 Thessalonians 2:1-12 (Epistle)
- Isaiah 49:6 (Prophecy)
- Matthew 28:19-20 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** The church at Antioch sends out Barnabas and Saul (now called Paul) on the first organized missionary journey. They travel through Cyprus and Asia Minor, establishing churches in Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe, facing both success and persecution.

**God's Bigger Plan:** This journey establishes the pattern for systematic gospel expansion and demonstrates how the church will fulfill the Great Commission. It shows God's heart for reaching every people group with the good news of salvation.

**Connecting the Dots:** Acts records the missionary journey's events. 1 Thessalonians reflects Paul's missionary methodology and heart. Isaiah prophesied about being a light to the nations. Matthew records Jesus' commission to make disciples of all nations.

****Theological Threads:****
- **Strategic Mission:** Organized, intentional evangelism and church planting
- **Cultural Adaptation:** The gospel crosses ethnic and linguistic barriers
- **Suffering Service:** Ministry involves both success and persecution
- **Local Leadership:** Establishing indigenous church leadership

**Study Questions:**
1. What can we learn from Paul and Barnabas's missionary strategy?
2. How did they handle both success and opposition?
3. What does their example teach about cross-cultural ministry?
