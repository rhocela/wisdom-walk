**Day:** 70

**When this Happened:** Throughout Galilee - Jesus' teaching and miracle ministry

**Readings:**
- Matthew 8:1–13:58 (Gospel)
- Mark 3:1–6:56 (Gospel)
- Luke 7:1–9:62 (Gospel)
- John 5:1–6:71 (Gospel)

**Historical Context:** Jesus' ministry intensifies with miraculous healings, nature miracles, and parabolic teaching about the kingdom. His authority over disease, demons, and death demonstrates divine power, while His parables reveal kingdom truths to those with spiritual ears to hear.

**God's Bigger Plan:** Jesus' miracles function as signs pointing to His divine identity and the arrival of God's kingdom. His parables reveal that the kingdom comes not through political revolution but through spiritual transformation, often in unexpected ways.

**Connecting the Dots:** All Gospels record extensive miracle and parable accounts. Matthew includes the parable discourse explaining kingdom mysteries. Mark emphasizes Jesus' power and authority. Luke shows Jesus' compassion for all people. John presents Jesus' "I am" sayings and their significance.
